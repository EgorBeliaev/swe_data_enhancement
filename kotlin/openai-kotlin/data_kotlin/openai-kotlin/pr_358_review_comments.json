This should allow us to support more service providers.\r\n\r\n## What problem is this fixing?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `ChatChunk.finishReason` is declared as nullable but does not have a default value. Serialization complains that the field is missing.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: [CIRCULAR REFERENCE: com.aallam.openai.api.exception.OpenAIHttpException: Field 'finish_reason' is required for type with serial name 'com.aallam.openai.api.chat.ChatChunk', but it was missing at path: $.choices[0]]\r\n```\r\n"
