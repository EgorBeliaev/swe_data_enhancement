Fix the handling of content type in the specified file to use "image_url" instead of "image". This resolves the issue #320 related to the "Invalid value: 'image'" error message when submitting content parts. Ensure compatibility with the OpenAI API specifications as detailed in the OpenAI API documentation. The relevant file for changes is `openai-core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com.aallam.openai.api/chat/ChatMessage.kt`, around line 214. This update aligns the implementation with the supported content types: "text" and "image_url".
