**Instruction for Implementation:**

- **Feature Addition**: Implement the feature to expose `logprobs` in the ChatCompletionRequest and response as done previously in the deprecated Completions API.
- **Objective**: Align the current implementation with OpenAIâ€™s API by adding support for `logprobs` in the chat completions.
- **Verification**: Ensure `top_logprobs` are included in responses regardless of limitations on the number of logprobs returned, as verified by test cases.
- **Issue Resolution**: This change addresses and resolves the issue logged in #326, thereby closing the gap between the current support and OpenAI's exposed features.
