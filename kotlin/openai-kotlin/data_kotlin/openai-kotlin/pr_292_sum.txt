**Instruction for Implementing Changes:**

1. **Feature Addition:** Introduce two new fields - `quality` and `style` - in the image generation feature.
   
2. **API Enhancement:**
   - Add a `quality` parameter to the API for image generation. 
   - This parameter should allow users to select the output quality, providing options for either 'standard' or 'HD'.

3. **Documentation Update:** Ensure updates are reflected in `/CHANGELOG.md` as you implement this new feature.

**Note:** The related issue being addressed by this PR is #291, which involved the inability to choose the image quality during generation. The issue has been closed.
