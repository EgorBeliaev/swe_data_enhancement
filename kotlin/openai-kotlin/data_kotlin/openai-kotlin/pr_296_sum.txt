Add the `RequestOptions` feature to all non-deprecated methods to enable overriding headers, URL parameters, and timeouts on a per-request basis. This addresses the issue where specifying different header values for each request was not possible. Ensure the `/CHANGELOG.md` file is updated to reflect this new capability.
