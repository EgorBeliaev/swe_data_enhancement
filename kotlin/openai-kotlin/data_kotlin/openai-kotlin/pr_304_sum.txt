**Instructions:**

1. **Fix `Tool` serialization:**
   - Move the `description` field from the tool level to within the `FunctionTool` object.

2. **Change `FunctionTool` parameters:**
   - Make `FunctionTool#Parameters` field nullable.

3. **Update `ErrorInfo` fields:**
   - Make both `ErrorInfo#message` and `ErrorInfo#code` fields nullable.

**Issue Description:**

The repository is currently experiencing an issue with serializing tool descriptions improperly when using chat completion function calling. Specifically, the `description` field is incorrectly placed at the tool level instead of within the `function`. This discrepancy works with the OpenAI API but causes an error with the stricter Anyscale API, resulting in a 400 error due to unexpected JSON format. The patch resolves this by relocating the `description` field and making necessary fields nullable to prevent serialization issues with other OpenAI-compatible providers.
