When attempting to analyze the steps after a run, I receive the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.aallam.openai.api.exception.OpenAIHttpException: Illegal input: Serializer for subclass 'file_search' is not found in the polymorphic scope of 'ToolCallStep'.\r\nCheck if class with serial name 'file_search' exists and serializer is registered in a corresponding SerializersModule.\r\nTo be registered automatically, class 'file_search' has to be '@Serializable', and the base class 'ToolCallStep' has to be sealed and '@Serializable'.\r\nJSON input: .....ousing act design manual.pdf\",\"score\":0.2420911092145576}]}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create an assistant with the file_search tool enabled / a relevant VectorStore provided.\r\n2. Execute an assistant Run with a message that will trigger a file search\r\n3. Wait until the Run is completed\r\n4. Attempt to iterate through the run steps:\r\n```kotlin\r\n// It's possible the exception is thrown during this call and we don't even\r\n// get to the step iteration below\r\nval steps = client.runSteps(\r\n    threadId = threadId,\r\n    runId = run.id,\r\n)\r\n\r\nfor (step in steps) {\r\n    when (step.stepDetails) {\r\n        is MessageCreationStepDetails -> {\r\n            // I was extracting message content here     \r\n        }\r\n        else -> {}\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n- **openai-kotlin version**: 4.0.0-beta01\r\n- **Kotlin version**: 2.1.0\r\n- **OS**: Manjaro Linux\r\n\r\n### Additional Info\r\n\r\nIt seems like an additional subclass of `ToolCallStep` needs to be implemented for file search steps.\r\n",
