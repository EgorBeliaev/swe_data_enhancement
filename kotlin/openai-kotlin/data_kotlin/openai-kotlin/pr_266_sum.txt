### Instruction to Programmer:

1. Implement a fix to ensure the 'tool_calls' field is included when the type with the serial name 'submit_tool_outputs' is used.
2. Update the data structures to align with the open API spec:
   - Introduce a sealed interface `RequiredAction` with a class `SubmitToolOutputs`.
   - `SubmitToolOutputs` should have a Kotlin class `ToolOutputs` as a property.
   - Ensure that `ToolOutputs` contains a `List` of `ToolCall` instances designated with the `@SerialName("tool_calls")` annotation.
3. Make the implementation future-proof for potential new tools by structuring as shown in the provided Kotlin snippet.
