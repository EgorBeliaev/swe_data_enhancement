**Instructions to Programmer:**

1. **Modify `Model.kt`:** 
   - Change the `created` and `owned_by` fields to nullable in the `Model` data class. This adjustment is necessary because certain endpoints, such as those provided by OpenRouter, do not include these keys in their JSON responses.
   
   ```kotlin
   @Serializable
   public data class Model(
       @SerialName("id") public val id: ModelId,
       @SerialName("created") public val created: Long?, // make nullable
       @SerialName("owned_by") public val ownedBy: String?, // make nullable
       @SerialName("permission") public val permission: List<ModelPermission>? = null,
   )
   ```

2. **Issue Reference:** 
   - The fix should address issue #331, which involves the application crashing when listing models from OpenRouter due to the absence of `created` and `owned_by` fields.

3. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - Be aware that this change may impact backward compatibility if the library or any part of the ecosystem relies on the non-nullability of these fields. Consider reviewing the implications of making these fields optional.
