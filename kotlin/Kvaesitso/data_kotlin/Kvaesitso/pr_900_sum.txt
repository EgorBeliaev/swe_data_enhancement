**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Migrating OSM Opening Hours Parsing:**
   - Implement the migration of OSM `opening_hours` parsing to use the external library [osm-opening-hours](https://github.com/westnordost/osm-opening-hours).
   - Ensure compatibility with existing `OpeningSchedule` interface; this migration should be an implementation detail.

2. **Testing:**
   - Add tests utilizing JUnit as other project parts like `:core:ktx` use it. Ensure sufficient coverage for the new parsing capabilities provided by the library.
   - Note: Android officially supports JUnit 4, and the usage is fine.

3. **Scope and Limitations:**
   - Consideration of the complete `opening_hours` specification is out of this PR's scope. Focus on adding support for more opening hours types than are presently available.
   - Do not implement support for month- or season-specific opening hours; these are not necessary for the current requirement of weekly previews.

4. **Finalization:**
   - The change should be implemented and tested properly, and once confident with the test coverage, mark the PR as ready for review.
