Still, this PR adds support for more types of opening_hours than currently available. I've added tests for parsing, feel free to have a look and tell me whether or not you think that is enough coverage...\r\n\r\nAnyway, I consider this to be \"ready for review\"."

                    "body": "I have come accross some cases where our current parsing of the OSM `opening_hours` tag is not correct. While digging into the issue, I discovered that in the meantime of merging the OSM PR, some new libraries for just that have popped up. One of them is https://github.com/westnordost/osm-opening-hours which is also used in https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete.\n\nI suggest migrating to that library instead of re-inventing the wheel, since also, our implementation does not cover month- or season-specific opening hours. What do you think?\n\nAlso, would you prefer this change to be a seperate PR or can I just include it in #772?",

We can also just skip tracking any season- or month specifics since we only show weekly previews; That is, I'd create the `OpeningSchedule` instance based on the library result and the users LocalTime."
