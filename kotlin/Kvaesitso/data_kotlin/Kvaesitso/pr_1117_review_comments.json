        "body": "This PR closes #617 and improves search UX by not redrawing search results until there are actual results by any `SearchableRepository`. This \"fixes\" the \"flickering\" that would otherwise occur when searching:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/723dbf1f-120a-4d1a-ad5a-fa6f3243b304\r\n\r\nI also went and replaced `MutableStateOf({Int,Float})` to the respective `Mutable{Int,Float}StateOf` that I found on the way, for good measure.\r\n\r\nNow, I haven't tested this much, so I'm not sure whether or not this introduces any regressions. But I think the result of an UI that does not flicker when typing is quite promising. Let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nAnd sorry for that messed up commit-history. :sweat_smile:\r\n"

If I understand correctly, this would make it possible to `.animatePlacement()` of search result items, by changing the list contents, instead of re-assigning the list that is wrapped by a `mutableState`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso/blob/5a7600a418a25ca44fc042f7a0d60ed7a2a88565/app/ui/src/main/java/de/mm20/launcher2/ui/launcher/search/SearchVM.kt#L59-L69\r\n\r\nEven without using `.animatePlacement()`, this way we should be able to just directly modify the lists with the results of `searchService`, instead of creating new lists.",
