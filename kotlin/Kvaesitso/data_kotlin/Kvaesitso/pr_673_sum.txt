**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Clock Widget Enhancements:**
   - Integrate two new setting flags for all clock styles:
     - "Show seconds" (Applicable only on default-sized Orbit style widgets; not compact).
     - "Use theme color" (Uses Material theme colors as accent; specific to Bold style Material You variant).

2. **Adjustments for Existing Styles:**
   - Update current clock widget styles to accommodate the newly introduced flags.

3. **Modification of Bold Style Variants:**
   - Remove MDY variant from Bold style.
   - Achieve similar results with the default variant by applying "Material You" and "Use theme color".

4. **New Time Provider Implementation:**
   - Introduce a new time provider specific for the clock widget.
   - Ensure minute-based updates when "Show seconds" is disabled.
   - Enable precise millisecond-zero updates for second display functionality.

5. **Introduction of New Clock Style:**
   - Add a new clock widget style named "Display", inspired by seven-segment LED displays.

6. **Time Provider Optimization:**
   - Solve excessive querying by creating a new `ProvideClockTime` provider for `ClockWidget` and `WatchFaceSelector`.
   - Adjust existing `ProvideCurrentTime` to revert to its previous functionality, handling updates tied to system events.
   - Optimize `ProvideCurrentTime` placement within the component tree for efficient operation.
