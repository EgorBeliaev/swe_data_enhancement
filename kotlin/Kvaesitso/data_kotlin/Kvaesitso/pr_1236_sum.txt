**Issue Description:**

The PR addresses the slow performance of the place search feature. The primary issue identified was the use of the `around` parameter, which was causing significant delays (up to 10 seconds) for simple searches within a range of around 4 kilometers. By switching to a bounding box method instead of `around`, the search performance is improved (from 10s to less than 1s). However, this introduces some inaccuracies in the search radius due to the nature of bounding box calculations. The bounding box uses degrees rather than meters which can increase the effective search radius beyond the intended 4 kilometers, up to approximately 6.3 kilometers.

**Instructions to Programmer:**

1. Replace the `around` parameter in place searches with a bounding box approach to improve search speed.

2. Implement latitude-based adjustments for the bounding box size as the size will vary based on the latitude.

3. Introduce a mechanism to discard results that fall outside of the intended search radius to mitigate issues with radius inaccuracy.

4. Consider implementing a user interface enhancement where a table of preset amenity types is displayed when initiating a place search. 

5. Ensure that fuzzy string matching is applied to handle variations in user input, such as different accents or synonyms, for better search result accuracy.

6. Maintain a list of translated categories and perform string matching to map user search queries to respective OSM categories within the overpass API query.

These changes will significantly enhance the search efficiency and user experience by providing faster and more accurate search results.
