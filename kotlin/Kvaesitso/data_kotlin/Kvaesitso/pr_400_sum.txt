1. **Fastlane Setup:** Implement initial Fastlane structure as discussed in PR #227. Use compressed HTML formatting in `full_description.txt` to prevent unwanted `<br>` tags.

2. **API Key Handling:** Ensure external service API keys (like Google Drive search) are configured optionally to disable features in F-Droid builds. Steps for setup can be found [here](https://kvaesitso.mm20.de/docs/developer-guide/external-apis/).

3. **Avoid Proprietary Dependencies:** Verify that all included libraries are purely FOSS with no transitive proprietary dependencies, especially in the context of Google and Microsoft cloud functionality.

4. **Custom Maven Repositories:** Remove or replace the Microsoft Azure Maven repository as it's not permitted by F-Droid. Refer to approved repositories [here](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/-/blob/master/fdroidserver/scanner.py#L439).

5. **F-Droid Compatibility:** Consider introducing a plugin API for features requiring external APIs, improving extensibility while aligning with F-Droid's guidelines. Address missing functionalities in weather services and other features.

6. **Dependency Confirmation:** Ensure all project dependencies are aligned with FOSS licenses (Apache 2.0, MIT, etc.). 

Note: The proposed changes align with fostering compatibility with F-Droid without inhibiting core functionalities.
