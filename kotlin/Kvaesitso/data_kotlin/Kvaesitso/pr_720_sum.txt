**Instructions for Implementation:**

1. **Documentation Link Addition:**
   - Add a link to the documentation about the unit converter on the settings page.

2. **Conversion Separator Recognition:**
   - Update the converter to recognize additional separators `>` and `-` for conversions in addition to the already supported `>>`.

3. **Supported Units List:**
