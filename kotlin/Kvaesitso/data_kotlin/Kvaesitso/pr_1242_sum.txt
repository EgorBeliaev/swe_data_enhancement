The pull request addresses a crash issue that occurs when attempting to reconfigure a widget in the settings menu. Here are the key changes and fixes made:

1. **Crash Fix for IllegalArgumentException**: 
   - Removed the usage of `pendingIntentCreatorBackgroundActivityStartMode()` from `ActivityOptions` to fix the `IllegalArgumentException`.

2. **Handling ClassCastException**:
   - Introduced a `getActivityFromContext()` method that safely traverses through base contexts to cast the current context to an activity. This prevents the `ClassCastException` and allows for silent failure if the context is not castable.

3. **Pending Issue**:
   - Unresolved issue where widget configuration changes are not reflected until the application is force-stopped. This was observed with the stock Clock app on the Android Studio emulator version 15 and may require further investigation or a separate pull request.

These changes were made to resolve issue #1221, which involves a crash when selecting "Configure widget" from the settings.
