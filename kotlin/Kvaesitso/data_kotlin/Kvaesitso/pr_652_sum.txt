The pull request aims to address color inconsistency issues across different Android versions and customization layers like One UI and MIUI by proposing the following changes:

1. **Implement a New Settings Flag**: Introduce a settings flag under the "Appearance" section to ignore system colors on devices running Android 12 (API 31) and above. This flag will allow the app to use the same color quantization scheme implemented for Android 8+, effectively bypassing the system's color retrieval.

2. **Update Codebase**: Reflect codebase changes due to a recent refactor in settings data. The integration of the new flag should not be done in the migration classes anymore.

The PR relates to resolving issues where launcher color reverts after closing settings, as seen on different customization layers (like MIUI) in Android 13.

Actions:
- Implement the new settings flag as described.
- Remove any integration attempts of this flag from the migration classes, according to the updated structure of the settings data.
