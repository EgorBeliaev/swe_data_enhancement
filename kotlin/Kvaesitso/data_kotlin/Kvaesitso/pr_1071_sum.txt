**Issue Description:**

The problem in the weather SDK involves incorrect assignment of WeatherLocation properties. Specifically, when the location is set manually, the SDK mistakenly switches the name and ID fields, requiring a workaround in plugins that use `WeatherLocation.Id`. This PR aims to address and fix this mix-up in the SDK.

**Instructions:**

1. Investigate the current implementation where `WeatherLocation` is set manually.
2. Identify where in the SDK the name and ID of `WeatherLocation` are being switched.
3. Correct the logic to ensure that the `WeatherLocation` name and ID are not transposed.
4. Document or update any necessary tests to validate that the issue is resolved and the correct `WeatherLocation` properties are assigned.
5. Note that no compilation test was conducted by the author; ensure to compile and test the module. Refer to the steps provided in the comment by user `MM2-0` if needed.
