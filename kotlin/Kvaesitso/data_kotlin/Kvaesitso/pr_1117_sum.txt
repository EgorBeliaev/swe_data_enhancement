- Update `SearchVM` and `SearchService` to improve search UX by preventing result flickering by modifying when search results are redrawn.
- Replace instances of `MutableStateOf({Int,Float})` with `Mutable{Int,Float}StateOf` for consistency and efficiency.
- Consider using `mutableStateListOf<Searchable>()` instead of `mutableStateOf<List<Searchable>>` in `SearchVM` to manage search results, which allows for potential future enhancements such as `.animatePlacement()` of search result items.
- If applicable, address the reasoning for not using `animatePlacement()` due to background animation issues, potentially exploring alternative methods that preserve the UI's integrity.
