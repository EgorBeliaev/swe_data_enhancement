The PR addresses a bug where Public Holiday OpeningHours with specified time were incorrectly classified as `everyDay` in the current system. It suggests a quick fix in preparation for a potential future migration to an external library for parsing opening hours, as initially proposed in issue #860. This interim patch does not involve altering the `OpeningSchedule` interface but proposes creating an instance based on results from the external library, optionally omitting month or season specifics. The main objective is to maintain functionality for weekly previews and ensure proper classification of Public Holiday OpeningHours before extensive changes take place.
