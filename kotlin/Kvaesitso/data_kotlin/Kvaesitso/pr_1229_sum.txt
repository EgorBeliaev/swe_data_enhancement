**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Add Tooltips to Widgets:**
   - Implement tooltips for the following widgets:
     - Weather widget
     - Music widget
     - Note widget

2. **Evaluate Tooltip Need:**
   - Assess whether tooltips are necessary for the favorites and calendar widgets.

3. **Strings for Weather Widget:**
   - Introduce 3 new strings specifically for the weather widget tooltips.

4. **Refactor Tooltip Code:**
   - Modify the existing tooltip code in the color palette editor and toolbars to utilize the same tooltip logic, ensuring consistency and code reuse.
   - Note: This modification inadvertently resolves a bug wherein a tooltip opened on a toolbar caused the keyboard to reopen and obscure the component once the tooltip was closed.
