This pull request focuses on standardizing all bottom sheets to use the standard components from the compose material3 library, fixing several existing issues in the process. The changes include:

1. **Bug Fixes:**
   - Fixed a small transparent gap between the keyboard and the sheet.
   - Addressed the need to swipe very fast to expand the sheet.
   - Resolved the issue where the sheet sometimes blocks users from exiting.
   - Corrected several button misalignments.

2. **Specific Scaffold Updates:**
   - **Tag Edit Scaffold:**
     - Added a label to the edit tag text box.
     - Prevented the creation of nameless tags.
     
   - **App Edit Scaffold:**
     - Transition animations added by opening icon selection in a separate sheet.
     
   - **Icon Edit Scaffold:**
     - Hidden the search bar when no icon packs are installed.
     - Hidden the "Suggestions" tag when there are no suggestions.
     
   - **Weather Location Scaffold:**
     - Upgraded the search bar to an actual search bar instead of a regular text field.
     
   - **Clock Widget Edit Scaffold:**
     - Matched button icons to text size.

3. **Limitations Due to Refactor:**
   - Removed sheet names, assuming users know the context when a sheet opens.
   - Top actions were moved to regular buttons where appropriate.

**Note:** Author suggests that although thorough testing was done, additional testing is encouraged to ensure no other issues remain.

*Discussion Note:* Unused strings exist but consensus is to handle these collectively in a future commit rather than this one to streamline the process.
