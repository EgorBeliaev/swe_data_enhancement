**Instruction:**

Increase the `MIN_FIELD_LEN_IOB` from 3 to 4 to ensure the negative symbol is displayed when the Insulin on Board (IOB) value is less than zero on WearOS complications. Note that this change may break existing tests, so ensure all tests are adjusted and pass after making this modification.
