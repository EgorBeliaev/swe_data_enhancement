### Instructions for Fixing the Issue:

1. **Objective**: Fix the default preference management related to the Custom WatchFace (CWF) rendering issue after upgrading from AAPS 3.2.0.4 to AAPS 3.3.0.

2. **Current Issue**: 
   - The Custom WatchFace (AAPS Large) does not render correctly post-upgrade.
   - Specifically, the white row ("MatchDivider") in the middle of the screen is invisible, along with its contained values.

3. **Workaround Identified**: 
   - Temporarily toggle each parameter of AAPS(Large) (Dark parameter and MatchDivider) on and off to restore visibility.

4. **Action Plan**:
   - Conduct a detailed review of the Custom WatchFace (CWF) code to understand the default value inconsistencies post-installation of the Wear APK.
   - Focus specifically on how default preferences are loaded and enforced.

5. **Solution Implemented**:
   - Philoul identified and applied a fix through commit `79edafef19110b7dfc00f39da7663303142140e1`, which addressed the root cause, potentially confined to the CWF.

6. **Verification**:
   - Confirm that after applying the fix, the default preferences align correctly and the watch face renders as expected without manual toggling.
   - Ensure there is no overlap without manual adjustments to "min ago," "Uploader Battery," and "Status information."

The described fix should eliminate the need for the workaround, fully restoring the functionality of the Custom WatchFace upon upgrade.
