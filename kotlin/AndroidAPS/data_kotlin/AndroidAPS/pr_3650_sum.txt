### Instruction for Implementation:

#### Feature Addition:
- Implement a new automation trigger that activates based on the steps count during a user-selected measurement duration, using a predefined set of conditions from the `SC` model.

#### Code Details:
- Due to the absence of `getLastStepsCountFromTime` in `StepsCountDao` within the `AppRepository`, use the alternative `getStepsCountFromTime().last { ... }` to achieve similar functionality.
- Ensure that this logic aligns with SQL queries from `StepsCountDao`.

#### Testing:
- Ensure the unit test and real life test cases succeed.
- Verify that the step count automation correctly triggers on actual condition changes (as tested by 'olorinmaia').

#### Note:
- The feature may prevent forgotten "Exercise" TT or similar activities.
- Address the AAPS discrepancy reporting lower steps count, as noted in the real life test (AAPS reports 90-110 steps per 5 minutes).
