Implement the following changes:

1. **Wear Profile Switch**: 
   - Allow negative timeshift values.
   - Adjust timeshift limits to -23h/+23h, replacing previous limits of 0h/+23h (wear) and -6h/+23h (phone).
   - Update step value for percentage in profile switch from 1 to 5.

2. **Improved String Descriptions**:
   - Update the string for duration in minutes for Loop State Disconnect Pump.
   - Enhance the profile switch string by adding the current profile name and append "h" to timeshift values.
