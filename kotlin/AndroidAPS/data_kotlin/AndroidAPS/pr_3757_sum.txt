### Instructions for Changes

1. **Update Communication Protocol**:  
   Adjust the communication protocol between AndroidAPS and the Equil pump to properly handle insulin doses of 10 units or higher.

2. **Implement Validation Check**:  
   Add a validation mechanism within AndroidAPS to verify that insulin doses fall within the supported range of the Equil pump before initiating injection.

3. **Injection Progress Update**:  
   Address the issue where the AndroidAPS app continues to show progress of insulin injection when the insulin reservoir is empty and the piston is retracting.

### Issue Being Fixed
The primary focus of this PR is to resolve the communication discrepancies between AndroidAPS and the Equil pump, especially concerning accurate insulin dosage handling and incorrect progress display when the insulin reservoir runs empty.
