To fix the unbonding issue with Omnipod Dash, make the following changes:

1. In `DashDeactivatePodViewModel.kt`, update the `discardPod` function by integrating the removal of bonding.
2. Implement a call to `removeBond()` in `OmnipodDashManagerImpl.kt`.
3. In Pod event `observeSendDeactivateCommand`, add `.doOnComplete { bleManager.removeBond() }` to ensure the unbonding process is completed after command execution.
