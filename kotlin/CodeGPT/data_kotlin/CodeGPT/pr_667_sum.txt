**Instruction:** 

- Integrate fixes for the Codestral model for code completion within `llama.cpp` as contributed in the PR.
- Investigate and address issues with building `llama.cpp` if attempting to update its submodule, since the current update on the master branch causes build failures.

**Note:** Further troubleshooting is necessary for the `llama.cpp` build issues following submodule updates.
