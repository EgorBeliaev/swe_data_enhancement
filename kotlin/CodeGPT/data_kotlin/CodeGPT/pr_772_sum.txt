**Instructions for Update:**

1. Utilize the Ollama `/api/generate` API to support the prefix + suffix format in FIM templates.
2. The current implementation lacks an API for context files, leading to a hardcoded deepseek-coder context format. Keep this approach until Ollama provides a formal API.
3. Make the FIM template configuration optional to support repository-level completions for models that don't support the new logic.
4. Consider opening an issue with Ollama regarding the models that haven't been updated to support the new templates.
