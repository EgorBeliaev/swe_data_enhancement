### Instruction for Implementation:

Replace the existing Java Swing `JTextPane` component used for the prompt text field with IntelliJ's `EditorTextField`. This change will enhance the user experience by integrating features such as:

- Spellchecking functionality.
- Auto-enclosure of brackets and quotes.
- Ability to remove suggestion action inlays.
- Enhanced context menu options for actions like copy-pasting.

This modification is aimed at significantly improving the user interaction when writing prompts within the application.
