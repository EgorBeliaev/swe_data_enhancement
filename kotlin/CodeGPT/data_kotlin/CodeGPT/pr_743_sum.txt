### Instruction for Feature Implementation (Auto Apply):

1. **Feature Overview**:
   - Implement an "Auto Apply" feature that automatically applies AI-suggested code changes to the active file with options to view, approve, or reject edits.

2. **User Interaction Flow**:
   - **Step 1**: Allow users to initiate a conversation by asking CodeGPT to modify an existing file or generate new code from scratch.
   - **Step 2**: Introduce an Auto Apply icon (lightning bolt) that appears on generated code blocks. Users should click this icon to trigger CodeGPT to analyze and implement the code changes.
   - **Step 3**: Present a diff view for the user to review proposed changes. Provide options for the user to either accept all changes and apply them directly to the file or reject them to keep the current version.

3. **UI Elements**:
   - Add an Auto Apply icon (lightning bolt) on top of each generated code block.
   - Ensure the visual representation of the diff view is clear, allowing users to easily review changes.

4. **Assets**:
   - Embed the provided images for better user understanding of where the Auto Apply feature is located in the UI.

Ensure that the implementation aligns with the existing UI/UX patterns in the repository for consistency.
