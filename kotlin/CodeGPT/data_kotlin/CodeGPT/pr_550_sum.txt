Add a text input field to the LlamaCPP server for setting additional environment variables, such as CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES. This enhancement addresses efficient GPU resource management in environments with multiple GPUs, allowing users to control GPU visibility and limit maximum GPU usage. This aligns with the need for improved resource management and flexibility, particularly in shared or multi-GPU setups.
