The proposed changes in the pull request introduce a system for collecting class structures in Kotlin using PSI tree analysis. This approach enhances code auto-completion accuracy and can be integrated for more precise response generation in chat applications. However, it's noted that using the PSI tree can become cumbersome and may not precisely resolve declarations without indexation of the entire codebase.

**Instructions for Enhancements:**

1. **PSI Tree Analysis**: The analysis captures class structures without using the Kotlin compiler. The implementation currently works only for Kotlin.

2. **Consideration of `Treesitter`**: It's suggested to explore using `treesitter` for better parsing and querying methods, constructors, and declarations.

3. **Future Improvements**:
   - Connect the Kotlin Compiler to enhance type recognition, especially for complex structures and generics.
   - Extend support for Java, with cross-project analysis between Java-Kotlin, Kotlin-Java, and potentially Python.
   - Seek advice for potential expansion to Go, TypeScript, PHP, and JS analysis.

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Consider creating a new chat action tag for including file structure analysis, similar to "Include Open Files".

5. **Merge Configuration**: Address any required permissions or configurations to enable the author to merge the pull request.
