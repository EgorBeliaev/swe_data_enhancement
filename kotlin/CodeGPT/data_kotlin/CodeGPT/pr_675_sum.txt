**Instructions for Enabling Vision Support in GUI for Azure Models:**

1. **Enable Image Action for Azure and Custom OpenAI Providers:**
   - Update `ServiceType.java` specifically at line 68 to allow the image action. This change accommodates providers with OpenAI API compatibility.

2. **Configure API Requests for Vision Support:**
   - Ensure that API requests are configured to handle vision capabilities for Azure models, leveraging existing compatibility with OpenAI's API. No additional UI changes are necessary since functionality might exist out-of-the-box based on API compatibility.

3. **Global Image Support for Azure Models:**
   - Implement image support universally for all Azure-provided models. Given Azure’s OpenAI-compatible API, vision functionality should inherently be available.

4. **Consider Model Naming:**
   - While enabling vision, consider that Azure model names are customizable. Avoid enforcing an OpenAI-like naming scheme, as it might be impractical for corporate environments.

5. **Handle Non-Supporting Models Gracefully:**
   - Determine the behavior when non-image-supporting models receive image input, ensuring it doesn’t result in crashes or unhandled errors.

These changes ensure vision support across different providers while maintaining compatibility and flexibility with existing API architectures and naming conventions.
