### Condensed Instructions for Implementation:

1. **Revert Model Display Logic**:
   - Ensure all CodeGPT models are displayed regardless of the user's pricing plan when the model dropdown is launched.

2. **Reorganize Model Dropdown**:
   - Implement submenus within the ComboBox to categorize models by provider.
   - Suggested change includes separating models into groups, such as "OpenAI", using `DefaultActionGroup.createPopupGroup`.

3. **Provider Enable/Disable Feature**:
   - Add an enabled checkbox for all providers in the settings screens, default to enabling only CodeGPT. Consider promo reasons for keeping it always enabled.

4. **Enhancements for Visibility**:
   - Separate models into cloud and local categories in the dropdown for better clarity.
   - Modify ComboBox behavior so submenus open on mouse hover instead of click. Achieve this in `ModelComboBoxAction` using:
     ```java
     @Override
     protected JBPopup createActionPopup(DefaultActionGroup group, @NotNull DataContext context, @Nullable Runnable disposeCallback) {
       ListPopup popup = (ListPopup) super.createActionPopup(group, context, disposeCallback);
       popup.setShowSubmenuOnHover(true);
       return popup;
     }
     ```

### Contextual Issue Description:
The PR addresses the confusion caused by an extensive and cluttered model dropdown list in the UI, which results from displaying models not in the user's pricing plan and requiring multiple password prompts. The solution proposes improved organization of the models and conditional visibility based on user configuration.
