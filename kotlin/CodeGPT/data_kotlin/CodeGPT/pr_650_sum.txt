**Instruction for Implementation:**

Implement a feature to support webpage references for additional context within chat sessions. This involves:

1. Allowing users to add links to documentation or relevant webpages in the current chat session.
2. Providing two methods for adding these references:
   - Directly via the chat dialog.
   - Through the settings menu (navigate to Tools > CodeGPT > Documentations).
3. Ensure this feature is only accessible via the CodeGPT API.

Include an interface update to display the referenced links as shown in the provided image.
