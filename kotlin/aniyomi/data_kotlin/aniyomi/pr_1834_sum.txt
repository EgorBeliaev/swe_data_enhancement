**Instructions for PR Implementation:**

1. **Move Files:**
   - Relocate `BaseMPVView.kt` and `KeyMapping.java` to the `mpvlib` directory.

2. **Add License Notices:**
   - Include a license notice at the beginning of all parts of the code borrowed from Abdallah, particularly in the compose components.

3. **Remove 'TODO' Comments:**
   - Go through the code and remove any `TODO` comments that are not planned for immediate implementation or are not necessary.

4. **Enhancing and Resolving Issues:**
   - Ensure useless files under `is.xyz.filepicker` packages are not included unnecessarily in the apk for better efficiency. However, be cautious not to affect stability when merging from upstream mpv-android.
   - Feature request for displaying multiple embedded subtitles simultaneously (e.g., using `mpvkt`), is resolved. Ensure multiple subtitle support through GUI if `mpv-config` is limited to external subtitles.
   
5. **Player Enhancements:**
   - Implement a feature to remember the last orientation of the player when changed using the provided button, and utilize this orientation for subsequent episodes until changed again.
   - Fix the issue with "Stretched to screen" setting causing a thin video ratio after selecting other episodes.
   - Implement a feature where double-tap to seek hides the progress bar, similar to apps like MX Player, YouTube, and VLC. Make this option toggleable.
   - Resolve freezing issue when resuming playback after pausing, especially when using the HW+ decoder.
   - Address the issue of media buttons not working for next/previous navigation within the internal player but only during PiP mode. Ensure full functionality inside the player as well.
   - Consider adding a volume boost option like VLC for more than 100% audio volume in the player settings.
   - Fix missing audio track issue in the player for local anime episodes, including the logic to handle two-letter language codes more effectively.
