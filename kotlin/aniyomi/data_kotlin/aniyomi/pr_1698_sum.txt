Title: Implement Video Filters in Player

Change Summary:
- Add video filters: Brightness, Saturation, Gamma, Contrast, and Hue.
- Note: Saturation and Hue are incompatible with `gpu` but function with `gpu-next`.

Related Issue:
- Closes #1670: Addresses the request from issue #1670 which needs options for video adjustments to mitigate display effects like "black crush" as experienced by the user.

Testing:
- Ensure filters can be toggled and effectively modify video display properties.
- Verify that the filters integrate seamlessly with the existing filter setup, particularly under `gpu-next`.

Additional Notes:
- Consult preview: [video link](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f2a6831-03c6-4a83-9f28-647572ab1597)
- Comments suggest availability of manual settings through mpv configuration, but front-end accessibility is the enhancement goal.
