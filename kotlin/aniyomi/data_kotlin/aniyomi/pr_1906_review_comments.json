        "body": "Added a size slider for the List Display Mode. It uses the same size variable as Grids do to determine size. However, the size of the List gets interpreted not as \\<number\\> of columns per row, but rather as \\<number\\> of entries of the list visible on the screen at once ([images 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba5e0599-3c97-4184-b3eb-8170022ed518) [and 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc641ef7-96e9-4287-982e-e339782aba46)). The default value is set to be 7 for the List. \r\n\r\nThe style of the List was changed: the cover is of Book resolution to match the Grids and for better visibility ([image 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3cc87ab-1208-4f8f-870b-6af179cc9ec3)).\r\n\r\nOther two lists ([browse list](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bdb5784-f7a6-4442-a385-6444f7f3bb12) and [migration list](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b9b707c-6a06-4535-b18f-74a8b3609cf5)) don't have editable size, but neither do browse grids, so it's fine. Instead they now have a predetermined size of 76.dp (was 56.dp previously) and are visually changed to match the library list style.\r\n\r\nThe size slider also has two additional text fields added, which would need translation (though i assume that's automated).\r\n\r\nThe max line restriction for titles was removed, allowing for longer names to be fully visible, given the List is set to a big enough size ([image 6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b9b707c-6a06-4535-b18f-74a8b3609cf5)).\r\n\r\ncloses #1894 \r\n\r\n### Showcase\r\n| ![Screenshot_20250128-175245_Aniyomi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba5e0599-3c97-4184-b3eb-8170022ed518) |  ![Screenshot_20250128-175239_Aniyomi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc641ef7-96e9-4287-982e-e339782aba46) | ![Screenshot_20250128-175513_Aniyomi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/614954ad-7c8e-459f-bdf4-af24efb20519) | \r\n| --- | --- | --- | \r\n| ![Screenshot_20250128-175315_Aniyomi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3cc87ab-1208-4f8f-870b-6af179cc9ec3) | ![Screenshot_20250128-175357_Aniyomi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bdb5784-f7a6-4442-a385-6444f7f3bb12) | ![Screenshot_20250128-175326_Aniyomi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b9b707c-6a06-4535-b18f-74a8b3609cf5) |\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20250128-181306_Aniyomi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cc458f1-d0fa-4550-86d8-aa74a50e16e0)\r\n![Screenshot_20250128-181329_Aniyomi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47f89810-9793-44ff-bfe9-8881b151f70f)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please include a summary\r\n\r\n of the change and which issue is fixed.\r\n  Also make sure you've tested your code and also done a self-review of it.\r\n  Don't forget to check all base themes and tablet mode for relevant changes.\r\n  \r\n  If your changes are visual, please provide images below:\r\n\r\n### Images\r\n| Image 1 | Image 2 |\r\n| ------- | ------- |\r\n| ![](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png) | ![](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png) |\r\n-->\r\n"

I want to be able to scale the List up to be like MyAnimeList (for example) has it on their app. \nIt would also allow for the whole anime name to fit on the screen (hopefully even for very long ones) .\n\n\n### Other details\n\nI'm hoping to take this issue for myself. Though I can't guarantee any deadlines ofc.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues and this is a new ticket, **NOT** a duplicate or related to another open or closed issue.\n- [x] I have written a short but informative title.\n- [x] If this is a request regarding an extension, I should be opening an issue in the extension's repository.\n- [x] I have updated the app to version **[0.16.4.3](https://github.com/aniyomiorg/aniyomi/releases/latest)**.\n- [x] I will fill out all of the requested information in this form.",
