Slightly dark areas become pitch black, being able to adjust the brightness and gamma kind of helps me mitigate this issue. Here is a video example. https://streamable.com/lmffc0\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues and this is a new ticket, **NOT** a duplicate or related to another open or closed issue.\n- [X] I have written a short but informative title.\n- [X] If this is an issue with an official extension, I should be opening an issue in the [extensions repository](https://github.com/aniyomiorg/aniyomi-extensions/issues/new/choose).\n- [X] I have updated the app to version **[0.15.3.0](https://github.com/aniyomiorg/aniyomi/releases/latest)**.\n- [X] I will fill out all of the requested information in this form.",
