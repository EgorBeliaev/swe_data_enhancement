**Change Instructions:**

1. **Feature Addition:**
   - Implement a size slider for the List Display Mode, utilizing the existing size variable used by Grid Display Modes. The slider determines the number of list entries visible on the screen at once.
   - Set the default size for the List to 7 entries visible.
   - Remove maximum line restrictions on titles, allowing longer names to be fully visible if the List size permits.

2. **Style Changes:**
   - Update the List cover style to match the resolution of the Grid for enhanced visibility.
   - Adjust the browse and migration lists to have a fixed size of 76.dp, previously 56.dp, aligning them with the library list style.

3. **UI Components:**
   - Add two text fields to the size slider for which translations might be required (assuming automated process).
   
4. **Visual Update:**
   - Ensure all base themes and tablet modes are tested for visual consistency.

5. **Issue Resolution:**
   - This PR closes issue #1894, which involves adding a size slider to enhance List customization similar to grid variants.

The programmer should ensure all components are adjusted accordingly and verify the changes by updating and testing across relevant visual themes and modes.
