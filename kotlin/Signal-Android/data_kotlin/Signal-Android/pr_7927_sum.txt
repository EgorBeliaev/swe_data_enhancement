**Instructions for Changes in the Repository:**

1. **Issue Addressed:**
   - The pull request fixes two issues related to message self-sends and group syncs:
     - Auto-download was not triggering for group messages.
     - Download controls were not visible for messages sent to oneself.

2. **Fixes:**
   - Ensure that group messages automatically download upon reception.
   - Make download controls visible for self-sent messages.

3. **Related Issue Closure:**
   - The pull request is linked to resolving issue #7920, which describes images sent from a desktop client to groups appearing blank on an Android master device. Note that this PR specifically addresses auto-downloading and download control visibility, though it is linked to broader image rendering issues in the repository issue.
  
4. **Verification:**
   - Validation has been conducted using a Google Pixel with Android 8.1, API 27.

By implementing these changes, the repository should now correctly handle auto-download and display controls for relevant messages.
