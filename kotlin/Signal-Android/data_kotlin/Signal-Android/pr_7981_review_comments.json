        "body": "The first large batch of changes to improve Signal's look.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting java change is likely `ConversationItem`, which renders the message items. There's a lot of work there around new rendering rules that take into consideration neighboring messages to collapse footers, round corners, show/hide the author, etc.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that because the position of the timestamp information changes based on message type (solo-images and shared contacts render the timestamp in a different location), the footer has been broken out to `ConversationItemFooter` so it can be re-used in different areas.\r\n\r\nAlso, because the way we show images has changed a bit, I've wrapped `ThumbnailView` into a class `ConversationItemThumbnail` so we can render the `ConversationItemFooter` and timestamp background shade without making `ThumbnailView` overly-specific.\r\n\r\n**Test Devices**\r\n* [Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_e_(2nd_gen)-6986.php)\r\n* [Galaxy S3 Mini, Android 4.2.2.
