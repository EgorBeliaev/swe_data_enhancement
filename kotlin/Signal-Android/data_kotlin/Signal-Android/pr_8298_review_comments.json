        "body": "Some phones, notably the Pixel 3, had some problems with scaling after taking photos. This fixes it by \r\nusing the takePicture API instead of pulling the bitmap from the TextureView.\r\n\r\nAs a nice side-effect, Pixel 2/3 will give us back the visual-core-optimized images, so those phones will get nicer photos. And most phones in general will at least give back smoother/less noisy photos.\r\n\r\nFixes #8292\r\n\r\n**Test Devices**\r\n* [Google Pixel 3, Android 9.0, API 28](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_3-9256.php)\r\n* [Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_e_(2nd_gen)-6986.php)\r\n* [Google Pixel, Android 9.0, API 28](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel-8346.php)\r\n* [Google Pixel 2, Android 9.0, API 28](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_2-8733.php)\r\n* [Moto G4, Android 7.0, API 24](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_g4-8103.php)\r\n* [Samsung Galaxy S9, Android 8.0, API 26](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s9-8966.php)\r\n\r\n"

This bug is present when using either the front camera or the rear camera.\r\n**Expected result:** The viewfinder shows the entire field of view available to the camera and the captured image matches what is shown in the viewfinder.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the Pixel 3 has two front facing cameras, one of which has a wide angle lens.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nNone available\r\n\r\n### Device info\r\n**Device:** Google Pixel 3\r\n**Android version:** 9\r\n**Signal version:** 4.29.4\r\n\r\n### Link to debug log\r\nhttps://debuglogs.org/cce520452a627c33512db3672978ff0467442cb4a0b62d2df12fa75f84550814",

This means it will always be a subset of the camera's actual preview, but that's fine, it's intended.\r\n\r\nOf course the captured image being distorted is a bug. From the technical side, it's actually pretty annoying. `TextureView#getBitmap()` is inconsistent between devices as to whether it applies it's transformation to the bitmap, and there's no way to tell what it's doing. I thought it was simply an Android P vs non-Android-P thing, but it turns out it's more complicated than that. Honestly, there's no quick fix, and the actual solution will involve me re-writing the image capture in a more substantial way."
