Audio files (MP3) with length of around 25-24 seconds and less, play with no problem. Audio with a length greater than 25 seconds can't be played.~~\r\n\r\n~~Found an oddity that 24 - 25 second length audio can be forced to play by repeatedly pressing the play button. After around 3 pressed, the audio will play. Pausing and playing again will raise the error. Have not found that this method allowed 30 second audio to be \"forced\" to play, as well as I couldn't cause 23 and less length audio to error out.~~\r\n\r\nUpon further testing, I've narrowed down that MP3s `>600KB` in size raises the `Error playing audio!`. MP3s audio files `<300KB` and smaller have no problems playing.\r\n\r\nAlso found that `.wav` files have no such problems. Even with a `.wav` file at a 30MB size had no issues.\r\n\r\nI've attached a zip with a ~300Kb MP3, ~600Kb MP3, and a 30Mb WAV audio for reproducibility.\r\n[audio_files.zip](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/files/1965425/audio_files.zip)\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Create MP3 audio file larger than 600KB. I used the `Voice Recorder` app off the Google Play Store to create the file.\r\n1. Upload audio file to yourself or a contact\r\n1. Attempt to play file in chat.\r\n\r\n### Device info\r\n**Device:** Google Pixel 2\r\n**Android version:** 8.1.0\r\n**Signal version:** 4.18.3\r\n\r\n### Link to debug log\r\nhttps://debuglogs.org/0cf5b12a54526d4f05d8d401f6564cfb374a1cbd115f7138b1617e54a30d79b2"
