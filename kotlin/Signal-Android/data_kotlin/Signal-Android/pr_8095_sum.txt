**Instruction for Changes:**

1. Display the attachment button within the compose text area by default, regardless of whether any text has been entered.
2. Remove the attachment option from the three-dot menu when text is present.
3. Adjust and clean up button paddings in the compose area to improve overall appearance and ensure responsiveness to different text sizes.

**Issue Description:**

This PR addresses the limitation where the attachment button was only visible before entering any text. The new change allows users to attach files even after starting to type.
