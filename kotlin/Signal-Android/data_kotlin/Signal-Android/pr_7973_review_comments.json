Because we listen to the system for contact changes to tell us when to sync, that could result in us sending an abundance of contact syncs to linked desktop instances.\r\n\r\nThis throttles these background syncs to happen no more than once every 6 hours. If a sync was throttled in the background, a dirty flag is set, and the sync request will be made the next time the app opens.\r\n\r\n**Test Devices**\r\n* [Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_e_(2nd_gen)-6986.php)"
