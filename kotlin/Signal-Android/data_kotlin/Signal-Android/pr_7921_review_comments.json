Previously, someone who was just added to the group wouldn't get the expiring message time until an actual message was sent.\r\n\r\n**Test Devices**\r\n* [Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_e_(2nd_gen)-6986.php)\r\n* [Google Pixel, Android 8.1, API 27](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel-8346.php)\r\n\r\n"
