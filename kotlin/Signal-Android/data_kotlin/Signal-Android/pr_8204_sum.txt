1. **New Feature Implementation:**
   - Add functionality to block groups, analogous to blocking individual contacts.
   - Ensure blocked users cannot be re-added to a group after leaving it.

2. **Bug Fix:**
   - Resolve the issue preventing blocked users from leaving groups and receiving messages ("Fixes #7970").

3. **Dependency Update:**
   - Upgrade `libsignal-service` to address websocket timeout issues ("Fixes #6644").

4. **Tested Devices:**
   - Verify implementation on Nexus 5X with Android 8.1, API 27.

**Related Issues:**
- The issue of blocked users not being able to leave groups, making them continue to receive messages from the blocker.
- The message delay issue potentially due to absence or mismanagement of Google Play Services on Android devices.
