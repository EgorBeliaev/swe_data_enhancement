        "body": "In preparation for the pending `targetSdk 26` requirement, we're changing `JobScheduler` to use the new `WorkManager` to execute tasks. The existing JobScheduler interface has been kept as close as possible to the original to reduce the amount of code changes. here's a general outline of the code changes.\r\n\r\n- Changed `Job` to subclass the new `Worker` class.\r\n- Job now essentially does what `JobConsumer` used to do -- i.e. it runs an `onRun()` method and returns the proper value (`SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `RETRY`) based on whether or not certain exceptions are thrown. This let's us keep all subclasses of `Job` identical, save the next step:\r\n- Because WorkManager requires all data be persisted via a `Data` object, two methods have been added to Job: `serialize()` and `initialize()`. These methods are responsible for saving and restoring instance state. So really, the largest changes in this diff come from having to do that for every job.\r\n- WorkManager also requires that every `Worker` subclass have a no-arg constructor, so one has been added to every job.\r\n- We migrate all outstanding persisted Jobs to run on the new JobManager after app upgrade. Our reliance of java serialization for persistence means that we unfortunately have to carry around all of our existing Requirement classes for the foreseeable future, even though we don't use them anymore (outside of migration).\r\n- To prevent the use of any new Requirements (which could only actually work if they're manually persisted in the data bundle, which I've done for the existing ones), I've removed them from JobParameters, instead using named setters for the requirements we already have.\r\n- Had to update our compileSdk to 28 to get WorkManager to work.\r\n  - Also had to update all of our support library versions\r\n\r\n**Test Devices**\r\n* [Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_e_(2nd_gen)-6986.php)\r\n* [Nexus 5X, Android 8.1, API 27](https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_5x-7556.php)\r\n* [Moto X (2nd Gen), Android 7.1, API 25](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_x_(2nd_gen)-6649.php)\r\n* Android 9 Emulator under various network conditions\r\n"
