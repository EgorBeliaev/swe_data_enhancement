Now we just show a little attach button in the text area.\r\n\r\nI also took the opportunity to clean up other button paddings and stuff in the compose area so things look better and react to text sizes more predictably.\r\n\r\n[Video Demo](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/files/2278703/attachment-button.zip)\r\n\r\n**Test Devices**\r\n* [Nexus 5X, Android 8.1, API 27](https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_5x-7556.php)"
