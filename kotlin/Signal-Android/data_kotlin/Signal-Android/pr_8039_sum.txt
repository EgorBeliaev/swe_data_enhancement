### Instruction for Implementation

1. **New Logging Layer**: Implement a new logging layer that imitates the `Log` interface.
   
2. **Add Loggers**: Integrate two new loggers:
   - **AndroidLogger**: Forwards logs to the standard Log command.
   - **PersistentLogger**: Saves logs to disk with these specifics:
     - Operates on a single-thread executor.
     - Logs to a file until a specified line count is reached, then starts a new file.
     - Maintains a maximum of 5 log files, deleting older files as needed.
     - Stores logs in the cache directory to allow system cleanup.

3. **Crash Logging**: Integrate a global `UncaughtExceptionHandler` to log crashes.

4. **Testing**: Ensure functionality on:
   - Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22
   - Nexus 5X, Android 8.1, API 27

5. **Logging Submission**: During log submissions, include both logcat logs and new logs to verify stability.

6. **PR Scope**: This Pull Request introduces the new logging layer without implementing any usage instances.

This PR addresses the issue of limited debug log duration by storing logs persistently and flexibly, replacing the reliance on local logcat polling.
