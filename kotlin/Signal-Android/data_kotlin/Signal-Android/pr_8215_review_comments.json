        "body": "This PR assigns new functionality to the quick-capture camera button. Instead of opening up a half-height camera, this will now open a fullscreen camera that allows you to capture, annotate, caption, and send a photo.\r\n\r\n[Video](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/files/2403259/camera-capture.zip)\r\n![camera-capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37311915/45849979-0e698b80-bce9-11e8-81c3-54894625ba2c.gif)\r\n\r\nThe general structure is:\r\n\r\n* The quick-capture camera button will now start CameraActivity, which when finished will provide a result that contains the Uri of the captured image, as well as the transport that was selected to send it.\r\n* The CameraActivity holds a Camera1Fragment, which uses the Camera1 API to capture an image. In the future, we could theoretically make a Camera2Fragment that uses the Camera2 API.\r\n* After an image is captured, CameraActivity will swap in a ScribbleFragment with the Uri of the captured image.\r\n* ScribbleFragment had to be refactored out of ScribbleActivity and given the ability to show a compose bar at the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\n**Test Devices**\r\n* [Nexus 5X, Android 8.1, API 27](https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_5x-7556.php)\r\n* [Huawei Mate 10 Lite, Android 7.0, API 24](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_10_lite-8857.php)\r\n* [Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_e_(2nd_gen)-6986.php)\r\n* [Google Pixel 2, Android 9.0, API 28](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_2-8733.php)\r\n* [Google Pixel, Android 9.0, API 28](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel-8346.php)\r\n* [Samsung Galaxy S9, Android 8.0, API 26](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s9-8966.php)\r\n* [Moto G4, Android 7.0, API 24](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_g4-8103.php)\r\n* [Moto X (2nd Gen), Android 7.1, API 25](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_x_(2nd_gen)-6649.php)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
