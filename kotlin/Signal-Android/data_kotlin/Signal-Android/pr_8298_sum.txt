**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Problem Description:**
   - Some phones, notably the Pixel 3, experience scaling issues when taking photos within the app. The preview becomes zoomed, hindering image editing before sending.

2. **Proposed Solution:**
   - Update the image capture implementation by using the `takePicture` API instead of the `TextureView#getBitmap()`, which is inconsistent across devices.
   - Ensure that the viewfinder accurately represents the captured image without distortion.

3. **Affected Devices Exhibiting the Issue:**
   - Google Pixel 3 (problem acknowledged both on open issues and comments)
   - Nokia 6.1 TA-1043
   - Huawei P20 Lite (front camera)
   - Xperia XZ1 Compact
   - OnePlus 6T
   - Samsung Galaxy S7
   - Samsung Galaxy S6
   - Galaxy J7 Pro

4. **Device Testing Post-Fix:**
   - Verify behavior on various devices, including but not restricted to the Pixel 2/3, Samsung Galaxy S9, Moto E, Moto G4, and others listed in the PR description.

5. **Expected Outcome:**
   - Eliminate the zoom-in effect in the preview phase.
   - Ensure photos captured align with what is presented in the viewfinder.
   - Enhance photo quality using potential device-specific optimizations (e.g., Pixel visual-core-optimized images).

Fix related to Issue #8292 and closed discussion around aspect ratio/cropping problems (especially on Pixels with dual cameras).
