        "body": "Added the ability to create a shortcut to a conversation. A new option \"Add to home screen\" will appear in the three-dot menu of a conversation. Clicking it will prompt your launcher to add a shortcut to that conversation to your home screen.\r\n\r\nNotable Changes:\r\n- Due to restrictions on how addresses and threadId's need to be passed, a new \"entrypoint\" activity was created, `ShortcuteLauncherActivity`, which will do threadId lookups and otherwise format to be passed to the ConversationActivity. The backstack is still built as expected.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to @leonardehrenfried for getting this started!\r\n\r\n**Test Devices**\r\n* [Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_e_(2nd_gen)-6986.php) -- Google Now Launcher\r\n* [Nexus 5X, Android 8.1, API 27](https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_5x-7556.php) -- Google Now Launcher, Action Launcher, Evie Launcher\r\n* [Google Pixel 2, Android P Beta](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_2-8733.php) -- Pixel Launcher, Evie Launcher\r\n\r\n"
