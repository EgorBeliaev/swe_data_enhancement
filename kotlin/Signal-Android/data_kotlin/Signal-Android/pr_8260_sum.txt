**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Ensure Immediate Download of GCM Messages:**
   - Modify the message download process to initiate downloads as soon as a GCM push is received.
   - Consider starting a foreground service if necessary to ensure timely downloads.

2. **Potential Code Improvement:**
   - Evaluate the current locking mechanism within the incoming message pipeline.
   - Consolidate the three existing locks into a single lock to minimize the risk of deadlock, if feasible.

**Test Verification:**
- Verify changes on the following devices:
  - Moto X (2nd Gen) with Android 7.1, API 25
  - Google Pixel 2 with Android 9.0, API 28

These instructions address the main changes proposed in the PR and incorporate the suggested improvement related to lock usage.
