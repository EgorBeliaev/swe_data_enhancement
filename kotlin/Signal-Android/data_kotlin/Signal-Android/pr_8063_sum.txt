**Instruction for Repository Update:**

1. **Feature Addition:** Implement the ability to create a shortcut to a conversation. Add a new "Add to home screen" option in the conversation's three-dot menu. This action should prompt the launcher to create a shortcut to the specific conversation on the user's home screen.

2. **Technical Change:** Develop a new activity called `ShortcutLauncherActivity`. This activity should manage the retrieval and formatting of threadId's to be compatible with existing `ConversationActivity`, while maintaining the expected backstack.

3. **Testing Requirements:** Ensure compatibility with the following devices and launcher setups:
   - Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22 using Google Now Launcher.
   - Nexus 5X, Android 8.1, API 27 using Google Now Launcher, Action Launcher, and Evie Launcher.
   - Google Pixel 2, Android P Beta using Pixel Launcher and Evie Launcher.
