                    "body": "- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates\r\n- [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended\r\n- [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports\r\n- [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Bug description\r\nImages you send yourself from the slave desktop client show as blank on the master Android client. This affects only groups, not 1-to-1 conversations. I tested with three groups. In two groups I have all the members in my Android contacts app. In one group there's one member that's not in my contacts. One group also has a member who uninstalled Signal long time ago. However, none of this seems to matter as the result is the same blank image in all groups.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n- send an image to a group from the Desktop client\r\n- view the group on your Android master device\r\n\r\n**Actual result:** The image is shown as blank space, tapping it doesn't do anything\r\n**Expected result:** Image should render, tapping it should open the gallery view\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![screenshot_20180621-113757](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/174176/41707956-0216022a-7548-11e8-8d9d-73a883257233.png)\r\n\r\n### Device info\r\n<!-- replace the examples with your info -->\r\n**Device:** Lenovo Moto G4 Play\r\n**Android version:** 7.1.1\r\n**Signal version:** 4.21.2\r\n**Desktop version:** 1.13.0-beta.1\r\n\r\n### Link to debug log\r\n<!-- immediately after the bug has happened capture a debug log via Signal's advanced settings and paste the link below -->\r\nhttps://debuglogs.org/950063b5edc224eb1f106e44d46a1c8535a45c2837d9032f06acbc552b1b7d61\r\n\r\ncc: @kpuljek (#7917)",
