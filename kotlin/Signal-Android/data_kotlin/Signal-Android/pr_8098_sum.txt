**Instructions for Implementing Changes:**

1. **Modify Database Schema:**
   - Add a new column `QUOTE_MISSING` to the messages table. This column should be set when a message quote is received but the original message is not available locally.

2. **Update Quote Handling Logic:**
   - Ensure that the text of the quote is set to the text of the original message if the original message is available.

3. **UI Changes:**
   - Implement a visual banner or footer under message quotes that are missing their original messages to inform the user.

4. **Issue Fix:**
   - Address issue #7850 where clicking on a quoted message from beyond the 'See Full Conversation' section results in a 'Quoted message not found' error.

**Testing:**
- Verify changes on the specified test device: Nexus 5X running Android 8.1, API 27.

**Issue Summary Being Fixed:**
When older messages (accessed by scrolling beyond 'See Full Conversation') are quoted, clicking the quoted message does not navigate to the original message and instead shows 'Quoted message not found'. This issue occurs for older messages but not for recent ones. Fix should ensure that clicking a quoted message navigates correctly even for older messages.
