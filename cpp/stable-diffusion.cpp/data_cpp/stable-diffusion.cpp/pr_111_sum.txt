Fix the `CLIPTextModel` by ensuring `work_output` is set to `NULL` at the end of the `CLIPTextModel::end()` method. This prevents a dangling pointer issue that leads to memory corruption and segmentation faults when multiple generation calls are made in a single `StableDiffusion` instance. This bug does not affect cases where the instance is created and used for a single call only.
