**Specifications for PR Review:**

1. **Objective**: Extend compatibility to support more LoRA models, specifically targeting Flux and SD3.x architectures.

2. **Testing**:
   - Confirm functionality on both CPU and Vulkan (unquantized) backends.
   - Identify any LoRA models that persist issues despite changes.

3. **Issues Addressed**:
   - This PR aims to resolve issues logged under [Issue #370](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp/issues/370) and [Issue #483](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp/issues/483).

4. **Action Required**:
   - Conduct thorough testing to verify what works and identify persistent issues.
   - Investigate compatibility challenges with LoRA models that have unique or "weird" naming conventions.

5. **Current Observations**:
   - Initial testing indicates trouble aligning `pos_embed` sizes with the full SD3 model.
   - Recent updates may have disrupted compatibility with previously working LoRAs; further analysis is required.

6. **Next Steps**:
   - Consider a refactor of the current logic to enhance SD3.x LoRA compatibility.
   - Explore and understand unconventional naming conventions that affect model compatibility.

Ensure to validate all proposed changes and address these details effectively before considering the changes for merge.
