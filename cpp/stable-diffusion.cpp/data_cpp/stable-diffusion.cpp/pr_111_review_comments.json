        "body": "`CLIPTextModel::begin()` creates a `work_output` tensor using the provided `work_ctx` but `CLIPTextModel::end()` does not set this value back to `NULL`, causing the next call to `CLIPTextModel::begin()` to not allocate a new tensor and use the value from the previous iteration instead, which is now a dangling pointer and thus invalid. This means that attempts to make multiple generation calls (`StableDiffusion::txt2img()`/`StableDiffusion::img2img()`) using a single `StableDiffusion` instance will cause memory corruption and results in a segmentation fault.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't affect the example \"sd\" binary as it creates the instance and only performs a single generation call before exiting, and this bug only occurs if a single instance is used for generation twice."
