### Condensed Instruction for Repository Update

**Objective**: Modify the application to support PNG images and ensure proper resizing for image-to-image (img2img) mode by ensuring compatibility with 4-channel (RGBA) images.

**Changes Required**:
1. **Input Image Handling**:
   - Update the image processing logic to accept and correctly process 4-channel RGBA images as this was causing an error: `input image must be a 3 channels RGB image, but got 4 channels`.

2. **Output Verification**:
   - Ensure that after modifications, the command to generate img2img results in successful creation of the output file without errors, as demonstrated by the successful creation message: "Create output_img2img_sdxl OK".

Please implement these changes, ensuring the application correctly supports 4-channel images and produces the expected img2img transformation output.
