**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Fix Upper Left Corner Handling:**
   - Modify the VAE tiling code to properly interpolate both x and y in the upper left corner to eliminate edge artifacts.

2. **Integrate Smootherstep Function:**
   - Replace the current blending function with `smootherstep` for interpolation in order to preserve more image detail and reduce the area where blending occurs.

3. **Code Modification:**
   - Ensure access to maximum x and y values in the interpolation function to avoid washing out right and bottom borders.
   - Utilize `std::min` for calculating `x_f` and `y_f`, ensuring accurate blending in overlapped regions.

4. **Optimized Loop Assignment:**
   - Relocate variable assignment outside of the inner loop in `ggml_merge_tensor_2d` for optimization, though current performance is acceptable with no perceptible impact.

5. **Bug Fix Reference:**
   - Completely fixes tiling seams as demonstrated in issue #353, addressing visible seams/artifacts near the edges of tiles.

6. **Test Verification:**
   - Validate changes by comparing before and after images to ensure that previously visible seems have been corrected.

7. **Co-author Acknowledgment:**
   - Include acknowledgment for contributions specifically addressing the interpolation and blending logic.

This PR resolves the issue of prominent seams/artifacts in VAE tiling by refining interpolation techniques and optimizing code execution, thus enhancing output visual quality.
