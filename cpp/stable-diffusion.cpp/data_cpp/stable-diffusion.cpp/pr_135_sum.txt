**Instruction:**  
Replace all instances where a log message is used directly as a format string with a properly formatted string to ensure that format specifiers cannot be injected. Specifically, in `examples/cli/main.cpp` at line 463, modify the `fprintf` statement to ensure that the log message is not used directly as a format string, to prevent crashes and resolve the compilation error related to `-Werror=format-security`.
