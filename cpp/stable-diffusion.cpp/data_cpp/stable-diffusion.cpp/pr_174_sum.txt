### Instruction for Implementing Changes:

**Feature:** Add capability to repeatedly run the ESRGAN upscaler in a row.

**Details:**

1. **Upscale Repeating Functionality:**
   - Implement the feature to run the upscaling model multiple times on the output of the previous upscale.
   - Ensure the upscaler runs with the same fixed-multiplier model each time (e.g., an `x4` model can upscale 512x512 to 2048x2048, then 2048x2048 to 8192x8192, and continue until memory limits).

2. **Command-Line Argument Addition:**
   - Introduce a new optional command-line argument `--upscale-repeats <int >= 1>`.
   - Default behavior without command: upscale once.

3. **Compatibility:**
   - Ensure minimal impact on existing code. Legacy versions and current usage without upscale repetition should operate unchanged.

4. **Testing:**
   - Already tested on M1 MBP. Verify on larger systems for handling higher resolutions (e.g., 32k x 32k and beyond).

This enhancement increases the flexibility of image scaling without altering the core model or its default behavior, by allowing repeated application for higher resolutions depending on system capability.
