### Instructions for Implementing PR Changes:

1. **JPEG Comment Block**: Implement a feature to include a JPEG comment block that saves the parameters used for image generation.
   
2. **JPEG Compression Output**: Modify the output behavior such that images are saved with JPEG compression when the file extension is `.jpg`.

3. **JPEG Quality Setting**: Set JPEG image quality to 90. This is intended to simplify command options without needing additional complexity.

This PR aims to enhance JPEG handling in the repository by incorporating metadata and compression features.
