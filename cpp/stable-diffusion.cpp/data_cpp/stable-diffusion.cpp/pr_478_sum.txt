### Instructions for Changes:

1. **Remove Default Variables in C Headers:**
   - Remove or update any default variables currently defined in C headers as specified in the PR.

2. **Adjust Default SLG Scale:**
   - Modify the default SLG scale value to 0 as part of the ongoing changes.

3. **Replace `std::vector`:**
   - Identify instances where `std::vector` is used and replace them with C arrays since `std::vector` is not compatible with C.

### Issue Being Fixed:

- This PR addresses issue [#477](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp/issues/477) by removing default variables in C headers and correcting the default SLG scale. Additionally, it rectifies the incorrect use of `std::vector`, which is not applicable in C, by replacing it with a C-compatible array.
