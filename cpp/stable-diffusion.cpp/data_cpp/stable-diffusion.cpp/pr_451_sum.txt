### Instruction to Programmer

1. **Feature Addition: SD3.5 Medium Support**
   - Implement support for the `sd3.5_medium` model.
   - Ensure compatibility with downloaded weights from designated URLs:
     - `sd3.5_medium.safetensors`
     - `clip_g.safetensors`
     - `clip_l.safetensors`
     - `t5xxl_fp16.safetensors`

2. **Run Configuration for SD3.5 Medium:**
   - Configure the command line executable `sd.exe` with the following parameters:
     - Model: `sd3.5_medium.safetensors`
     - Clip Models: `clip_l.safetensors`, `clip_g.safetensors`
     - Text Encoder: `t5xxl_fp16.safetensors`
     - Image dimensions: `-H 1024 -W 1024`
     - Prompt: `'a lovely cat holding a sign says "Stable diffusion 3.5 Medium"'`
     - CFG Scale: `4.5`
     - Sampling Method: `euler`

3. **Skip Layer Guidance (SLG) Feature:**
   - Implement SLG as an alternative to Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG).
   - Note SLG provides improved output quality at a cost of longer inference.
   - Modify the sample command with `--slg-scale` parameter for testing:
     - Command comparison with and without `--slg-scale 2.5`.

4. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Include comparison of sampling time between CFG and SLG configurations.
   - CFG (30 steps): `73.46s`
   - SLG (30 steps): `79.44s`

5. **Testing Configuration on AMD iGPU:**
   - Validate functioning of the above with AMD iGPU using Vulkan and CPU.
   - Test both `Q8_0` and `fp16` model configurations.

### Issues Fixed by this PR:
- This PR addresses and closes the issue with integrating support for SD3.5 Medium model as specified in Issue [#450](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp/issues/450).

By following these instructions, ensure the new model support and SLG feature are correctly integrated, achieving expected enhancements in output quality with appropriate runtime configurations.
