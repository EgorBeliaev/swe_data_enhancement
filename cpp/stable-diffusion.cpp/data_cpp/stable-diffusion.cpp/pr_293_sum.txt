**Issue Description:**
The Pull Request addresses a compilation error encountered when building the `stable-diffusion.h` C headers. The issue is due to a missing `enum` keyword for the type `sd_type_t` in the function, resulting in an error message during the build process. The error requires specifying the `enum` tag to refer to the type `sd_type_t`.

The proposed change involves updating the C header files to include the `enum` keyword with the type `sd_type_t`, which resolves the build error, ensuring compatibility with different compilers.
