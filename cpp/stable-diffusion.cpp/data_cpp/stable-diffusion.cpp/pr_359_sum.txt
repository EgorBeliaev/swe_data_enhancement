The Pull Request introduces inplace conversion support for the `f8_e4m3` format. It is implemented similarly to how `bf16` losslessly converts to `fp32`, allowing `f8_e4m3` to convert losslessly to `fp16`. The current merge base is `flux`, but the author is open to retargeting to `master` if needed.
