Add functionality to write generation parameter EXIF data, including prompt, negative prompt (if nonempty), seed, sampler, and other parameters, into the output PNG files as a tEXt block, similar to AUTOMATIC1111 webui. Implement this as either an always-on feature or opt-out option, without modifying `stb_image_write`. Instead, handle the integration within `main.cpp` using `stbi_write_png_to_memory` and adjust the README.md to document this new feature.
