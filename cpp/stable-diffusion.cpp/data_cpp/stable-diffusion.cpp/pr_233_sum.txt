**Issue Description:**  
The PR addresses a problem in the GGML library where tensor creation fails if the number of dimensions (`n_dims`) is outside the allowed range. This issue causes an assertion failure in the GGML source code at line 2745 of `ggml.c`:

```c
assert(n_dims >= 1 && n_dims <= GGML_MAX_DIMS);
```

**Change Introduced:**  
To fix this, the code now skips over `tensor_storage` entities with `n_dims` outside the specified range. This change resolves the loading issue, as demonstrated with tests done using the `Expressive_H` Lora model. The logs indicate successful loading and application of LoRA tensors after the fix.

Before the fix:
- Loading fails with assertion error due to invalid `n_dims`.

After the fix:
- Tensors load successfully and are applied, with all expected tensors processed correctly.
