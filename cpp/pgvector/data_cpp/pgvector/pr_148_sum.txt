### Issue Description:
The PR addresses an issue where the input function does not allow trailing spaces in input vectors. This results in an error for inputs like `'[0.24    ]'::vector(1)` but works correctly for inputs without trailing spaces like `'[0.24]'::vector(1)`.

### Instructions for Changes:
1. **Enhance Input Functionality**: Modify the input function to handle trailing spaces properly, aligning it with PostgreSQL behavior where trailing spaces are ignored in array inputs.
   
2. **Character Checking**: Implement character checking using a convention similar to the PostgreSQL `array_isspace` function. Since `array_isspace` is static in PostgreSQL, you will need to reimplement a similar function for the repository.

3. **Testing**: Add a test case to verify that the input function correctly handles inputs with leading and trailing spaces, ensuring they do not result in syntax errors.

4. **CI Verification**: Ensure that all changes pass the Continuous Integration (CI) checks.

### Notes:
- Review the existing implementation of `array_in` in PostgreSQL (as referenced in the PR discussion) to understand how spaces are handled in array inputs.
- Double-check any inline comments or reviews for additional insights or feedback that may have been implemented already.
