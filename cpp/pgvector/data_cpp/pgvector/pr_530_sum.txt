### Instruction:

1. **Fix Overflow Issue**: Modify the `subvector()` function to handle the potential integer overflow in the calculation `end = start + count`.

2. **Consider Type Change**: Evaluate the approach to change `end` and `dim` from their current type to `int64` to reduce error-proneness. Check if `CheckDim` needs its argument type changed to `int64`.

3. **Add Test Cases**: Implement new test cases to ensure that the overflow issue does not occur and that the function handles large `start` values correctly.

4. **Contribution Confirmation**: Confirm that additional test cases are added to cover various scenarios as part of ensuring the robustness of the solution.

### Context of Issue Being Fixed:

The PR addresses an integer overflow issue in the `subvector()` function where the calculation `end = start + count` can overflow if `start` is too large, leading to a segmentation fault later in the function.
