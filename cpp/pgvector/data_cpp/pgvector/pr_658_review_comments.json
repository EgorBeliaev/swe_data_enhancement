        "body": "A feature targeted for PostgreSQL 18 (postgres/postgres@e2225346) that makes optimizations around disabled path nodes impacted pgvector such that PostgreSQL would choose to perform an index scan when it should have used a different scan (e.g. `SELECT count(*) FROM table`). Per upstream guidance[1], the recommendation is to switch to using `get_float8_infinity()`, which achieves the same behavior in backbranches, and can be adapated to work with the new behavior introduced in PostgreSQL 18.\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/2281822.1724441531%40sss.pgh.pa.us"
