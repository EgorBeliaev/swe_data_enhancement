**Instruction for Programmer:**

Issue Description:
- Clipper offset operations in the OpenSCAD repository are causing self-intersecting polygons and producing geometry bugs, specifically strange pointy artifacts in both inward and outward directions after offsets. The issue is inconsistent but reproducible under certain conditions.

Change Required:
1. Implement simplification of polygons after offset operations using Clipper, as recommended in Clipper's documentation, to eliminate self-intersecting polygons.
2. Ensure this simplification process is included after all offset operations, especially when multiple offsets are performed in sequence.

Impact:
- This change will address the primary bug causing unexpected geometrical artifacts described in issue #5554.
- The implementation should prevent geometry errors and ensure consistent outcomes matching expected behaviors as shown in provided screenshots.

Note:
- Refer to Clipper documentation for appropriate simplification methods [here](https://www.angusj.com/clipper2/Docs/Units/Clipper.Offset/Classes/ClipperOffset/_Body.htm).
- Verify consistency between the nightly and stable release builds once changes are implemented to ensure no regression is introduced.
