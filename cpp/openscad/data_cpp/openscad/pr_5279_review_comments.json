        "body": "Hi all, \r\n\r\nWith @lakfel we would like to implement parts of the work presented in this paper https://thomaspietrzak.com/bibliography/gonzalez23.pdf by [Johann Felipe Gonzalez](https://cil.csit.carleton.ca/staff-members/johann-felipe-gonzalez-avila/) et Al . \r\n\r\nThe present PR is the first part containing interactive visual feedback in the text editor when user is selecting different object in the 3D view. The second part will consist in interactive visual feedback as overlay in the 3D view.\r\n\r\nA small video of the first part: \r\n[![Video showing the feature](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4_XNRgZO_MY/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4_XNRgZO_MY)\r\n\r\nIn this video we can see how the active selection impact the text editor content. In green are represented the selected objects and the call stack depth (with the small markers in the left side number from 1 to 5 ). In pink is represented the \"impacted\" objects. These are the objects that would be changed if the active object is editted. \r\n\r\nI'm now working on the second part of the (the 3d view visual feedback) takes more time as I was stuck with somes issues (https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/5237, https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/5274, https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/4595, https://github.com/openscad/openscad/pull/5272).
