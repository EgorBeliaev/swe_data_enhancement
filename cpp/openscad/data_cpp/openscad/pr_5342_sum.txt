The issue addressed by this PR pertains to making the Manifold integration within the repository release-ready. The goal is to update various functionalities to support Manifold as a backend while ensuring it can co-exist with the existing CGAL backend. 

### Instructions:
1. **Integrate Manifold's Updated Build Setup:**
   - Prepare for Manifold V3 integration.

2. **Make CGAL Optional:**
   - Disable `ENABLE_CGAL` option with potential loss of functionality to identify all CGAL code paths.

3. **Fix Existing Bugs and Functionalities:**
   - Address the convexity issue and manifold import failures.
   - Move Manifold out of the experimental stage and establish it as the default backend, necessitating test framework updates and resolving non-manifold conversion warnings.

4. **Update Specific Features Using Manifold:**
   - Diagnose and transition features like 3D hulls, `projection(cut=true)`, and improve caching strategies to support Manifold.
   - Enhance `CGALRenderer` and `GeometryEvaluator` to support manifold operations.

5. **Minkowski Operations:**
   - Optimize usage with Manifold for handling large unions of convex objects.

6. **Integration of Backend Options:**
   - Add UI and command-line features to let users choose between Manifold and CGAL.

7. **Address Tech Debt:**
   - Refactor pattern usage in code to improve elegance and maintainability.

8. **Conduct Large-scale Testing:**
   - Test OpenSCAD with both CGAL and Manifold backends to cover more cases and ensure functionality before release.

This PR addresses any functionality that may block moving Manifold out of the experimental tag while ensuring it co-exists effectively with the CGAL backend. The ultimate aim is to possibly make Manifold the default backend after thorough testing and debugging. Additionally, there are considerations to progressively minimize reliance on CGAL while retaining its strengths, especially for specific operations like mesh repair and Minkowski transformations.
