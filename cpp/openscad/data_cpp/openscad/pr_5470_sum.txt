**Instructions for Programmer:**

1. **Buffer Implementation:**
   - Implement a `std::ostringstream` buffer to temporarily store binary STL data, enabling triangle count updates at the correct offset (80 bytes) without relying on seek operations.
   
2. **Header and Placeholder Management:**
   - Write a placeholder for the triangle count immediately after the STL file header.
   - Update the actual triangle count in the buffer once calculated.

3. **Error Logging for Triangle Count:**
   - Add a mechanism to log an error if the triangle count exceeds the 32-bit unsigned integer maximum value (4,294,967,295).

4. **ASCII Mode Handling:**
   - Ensure ASCII STL data is directly written to the output stream, maintaining current behavior without changes.

5. **Compatibility Enhancement for Non-seekable Streams:**
   - Ensure binary STL files written to `stdout` or other non-seekable streams are prepared in the buffer and then flushed to the stream to ensure consistency and validity.

**Automated Testing Suggestions:**

1. Set up a framework to capture and verify `stdout` output, possibly by redirecting `stdout` to a temporary file.
2. Implement test cases for:
   - Binary STL export to `stdout`.
   - ASCII STL export to `stdout`.
   - Large models with numerous triangles.
   - Edge cases such as zero triangles or maximum triangle counts.
   
Ensure any new test scripts are compatible with languages like Python or Bash as needed.
