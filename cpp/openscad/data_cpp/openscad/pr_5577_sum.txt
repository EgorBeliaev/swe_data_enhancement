### Instructions for Implementation:

1. **New 3MF Export Dialog:**
   - Implement a new dialog for exporting 3MF files.
   - Ensure its functionality is in line with existing export dialogs.

2. **Update PDF Export Dialog:**
   - Modify the PDF export dialog to match the new layout and design of the 3MF export dialog.

3. **Dialog Visibility Preferences:**
   - Create a preferences page to toggle the visibility of export dialogs.
   - Implement functionality allowing users to bypass the dialog with "Always show dialog" disabled, but enable dialog with SHIFT + Menu.

4. **Command Line Enhancements:**
   - Enable multiple uses of the `-O` parameter for setting values with the format `section/key=value`.
   - Add a new command line parameter `--help-export` to display available settings.

5. **Merge and Implement ToDos:**
   - Address the issue of mixing parts with and without color by removing the option for this scenario.
   - Consider compatibility with V1, implementing all possible features except for the precision option, which is only available in V2.

6. **Command Line Settings:**
   - Ensure settings for `export-pdf` and `export-3mf` are correctly configured and tested, as detailed in the provided list of parameters and values.

7. **Testing and Automation:**
   - Plan for potential automated testing of new command-line options, though it might require significant effort.

### Note on Additional Discussions:
- Explore extending the Customizer parser to auto-fill fields in the 3MF export form.
- Investigate adding meta-data capabilities in OpenSCAD scripts to map between modules and 3MF parts as a long-term goal.
