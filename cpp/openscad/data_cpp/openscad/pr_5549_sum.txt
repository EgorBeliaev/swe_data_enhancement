**Instruction for Implementation:**

1. **Enhance `quantizeVertices`:** Modify the `quantizeVertices` function to support the inclusion and handling of colors. 

2. **Bug Fix in CGAL Mode:**

   - **Problem:** Importing a colored OFF/3MF file in CGAL mode could result in an assertion failure if the size of `color_indices` does not match the size of `indices` for `polyset`.
   
   - **Solution:** Implement a fix to either synchronize color indices appropriately or remove color data before processing polysets in CGAL mode to prevent assertion failure.

3. **Testing:**
   
   - Ensure test cases are written and executed to verify the functionality works correctly with colored files when importing in CGAL mode.
