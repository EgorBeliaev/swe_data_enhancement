### Instruction for Changes:

1. **Modify `rotate_extrude` Behavior:**
   - Ensure `rotate_extrude` starts on the -X axis when no angle is specified, maintaining backward compatibility.
   - Change the behavior for `rotate_extrude(angle=360)` to start on the +X axis, aligning with all other specified angles and consistent with circles and cylinders.

2. **CSG Export Change:**
   - Remove the `angle` parameter from CSG output when it wasn't specified in the OpenSCAD input to allow CSG files executed as OpenSCAD input to behave predictably.

3. **Test Adjustments:**
   - Update local test cases to accommodate the change in `rotate_extrude` behavior, specifically removing explicit "angle=" where not specified originally.
   - Regenerate image outputs for tests that show convexity artifacts, ensuring they reflect updated behavior changes.

4. **Additions and Deprecations:**
   - Introduce a `start` parameter for `rotate_extrude`, with a default value:
     - Default to 0 when an angle is specified.
     - Default to 180 when no angle is specified to maintain existing behavior.
   - Implement a warning system for when no angle is specified and $fn results in an odd number, preparing for future defaults to be more consistent.

These changes aim to resolve inconsistencies in the rotational starting axis for full extrusions and address issues related to backward compatibility and exporting scenarios.
