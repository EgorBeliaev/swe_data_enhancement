**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. Replace the current ad-hoc 7-segment font for axis numbering with the Hershey Simplex font.
2. Implement a text drawing function that abstracts drawing instructions, which does not need to interact directly with `glVertex3D()`.
3. Extend character rendering to include all ASCII characters from Hershey Simplex font.
4. Apply these changes specifically in the `GLView::decodeMarkerValue()` function for improved axis label readability.
5. Center numbers horizontally on the corresponding axis tick marks, ensuring proper readability even on the negative axis.
6. Adjust the default projection so labels facing forward on the coordinate system (fix Y and Z axes).
7. Verify that additional characters (e.g., `1e+06`, `0.16`) display correctly with improved readability.
8. Ensure all new files are covered under the GPL license, and attribute Hershey appropriately.

**Context for Repository Fix:**

This PR improves the readability of axis labels by switching from a 7-segment font to the simpler and clearer Hershey Simplex font. The change enhances label accuracy from different view angles and adjusts label placement for better visual clarity.
