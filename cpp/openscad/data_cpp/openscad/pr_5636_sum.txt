The code in `manifoldutils.cc` must consistently utilize `std::optional`. Currently, an error occurs when attempting to build without CGAL, indicating that 'optional' is not a member of 'std'. Adjust the code to ensure `std::optional` is correctly utilized and recognized during the build process without CGAL.
