**Instruction for the Programmer:**

1. Replace the custom `boostfs_uncomplete` function with the standard `filesystem::relative` function.
2. Update the project requirements to Boost 1.60 in the README and dependency check scripts.
3. Evaluate the feasibility of swapping `boost::filesystem` for `std::filesystem` before merging:
   - Confirm libstdc++ version compatibility (>= 8.1).
   - Evaluate macOS compatibility, ensuring minimum version is 10.15.
   - Investigate implications of `std::filesystem::last_write_time` returning `std::filesystem::file_time_type` instead of `std::time_t`.
   - Make sure this does not impact any functionality, particularly caching relative to filenames.

Ensure CI tests reflect the necessary changes to macOS version requirements. Adjust documentation, especially the system requirements on the download page, accordingly.
