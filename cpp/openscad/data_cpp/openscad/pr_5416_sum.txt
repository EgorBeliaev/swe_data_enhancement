**Instruction for Update:**

Implement a fallback mechanism for `fs::absolute` calls with empty paths:
- Detect scenarios where `std::filesystem::absolute` might throw a `std::filesystem_error` due to receiving an empty path.
- Ensure the function defaults to `fs::current_path()`, maintaining behavior consistent with `boost::filesystem::absolute`.

**Note:** This update mirrors previous behavior, allowing for further consideration on the use of `current_path` as a fallback in OpenSCAD.
