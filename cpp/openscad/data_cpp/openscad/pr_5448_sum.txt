The GitHub PR titled "Get canonical location before asking for parent path" addresses the issue of OpenSCAD crashing when executed from a symlink, particularly when installed via Homebrew on macOS.

### Instructions for Changes to be Made:
1. **Resolve Symlink**: Implement changes to ensure OpenSCAD resolves the canonical location of its executable before attempting to determine the parent path. This is critical for correctly handling symlinks.
2. **Dependency Removal**: Remove `boost::filesystem` from OpenSCAD's dependencies as part of this update.
3. **Execution from Symlinks**: Investigate and fix issues related to running OpenSCAD from a symlink, particularly with its installation via Homebrew.
4. **Wrapper Script Consideration**: Consider implementing a wrapper script that invokes `/Applications/OpenSCAD.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenSCAD`, passing on all parameters to address symlink path issues.

### Issue Description:
The issue addresses a crash occurring when OpenSCAD is run from a symlinked path on macOS, notably in Homebrew installations. This problem relates to incorrect path resolution, causing application instability and crashes during execution.
