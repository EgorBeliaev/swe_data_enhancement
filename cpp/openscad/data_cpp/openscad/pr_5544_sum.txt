**Condensed Instructions:**

1. **Bug Description:**
   - The function `linear_extrude()` when applied to a `hull` structure in OpenSCAD leads to an assertion failure and a core dump.

2. **Reproduction Steps:**
   - Create a .scad file containing: `linear_extrude(10) hull() square(10);`
   - Run OpenSCAD with this file to observe the crash.

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - OpenSCAD should handle the script cleanly, without crashing, and either render the contents or show appropriate error messages if there are syntax errors.

4. **Technical Detail:**
   - Assertion failure occurs at `extrudePolygon` in `linear_extrude.cc` due to unsanitized polygons. The error message is: `Assertion 'poly.isSanitized()' failed.`

5. **Probable Cause & Fix:**
   - The issue is possibly related to the recent upgrade to Clipper2.
   - **Task:** Sanitize polygons before extrusion in `linear_extrude.cc`.
   - **Additional Task:** Implement a regression test to prevent future occurrences of this issue.

6. **Environment Details:**
   - The issue occurs in OpenSCAD Version: 2024.12.29 on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS with AMD Radeon Vega 10 Graphics.
