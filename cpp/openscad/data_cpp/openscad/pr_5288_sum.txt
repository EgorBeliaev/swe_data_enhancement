This PR adds support for exporting PovRay scripts from OpenSCAD. Key changes and instructions for updates are as follows:

1. **PovRay Export Functionality**:
   - Implement the functionality to export PovRay scripts, focusing on exporting triangles instead of the original CSG scripting.

2. **Warnings and Errors Handling**:
   - Ensure compatibility with PovRay 3.7 by addressing the warning related to `assumed_gamma` and `#version` directive:
     - Explicitly specify `assumed_gamma 1.0` in the `global_settings`.
     - Ensure `#version` is the first declaration in the scene file.

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Wire up automated tests to ensure the export functionality is working correctly. Add tests similar to the existing tests for formats like OFF and OBJ.
   - Use the `EXPORT_POV_TEST_FILES` and include in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`.

4. **Export and Scene Configuration**:
   - Incorporate bounding box calculations to set the camera position relative to the object's center.
   - Adjust default light positions and camera perspectives to mimic OpenSCAD’s defaults for better initial rendering results.

5. **Code Improvements**:
   - Replace manual bounding box calculations with `auto bbox = polyset.getBoundingBox()`.
   - Use more descriptive variable names and refactor repetitive code blocks for clarity and maintenance.
   - Avoid using deprecated float-to-double conversions where not necessary.

6. **Lighting and Rotation Adjustments**:
   - Suggest aligning PovRay’s lighting defaults with OpenSCAD’s lights.
   - Ensure that exported views match OpenSCAD’s viewport, considering both rotation and light placement.

7. **Feedback Application**:
   - Address the issue raised about default colors, ensuring consistent use of white or OpenSCAD’s default yellow.
   - Consider supporting real materials in exported PovRay scripts.

8. **File Structure and Documentation**:
   - Correctly structure camera and lighting configurations in the exported files to allow easy modifications by users.
   - Plan to extract and utilize the OpenSCAD viewport for better user experience.

9. **Follow-up Actions**:
   - Continue developing tools or scripts to assist with camera and lighting adjustments in the PovRay exported files.
   - Prepare for a future update that could allow exporting before the triangulation phase for more efficient PovRay scripts. 

By incorporating these changes, the PR aims to expand OpenSCAD’s exporting capabilities with more reliable and customizable PovRay script generation.
