**Instructions:**

1. **File Refactoring:**
   - Split `openscad_gui.cc` from `openscad.cc`.
   - Remove redundant fields from `ExportInfo` and position platform-specific file-format handling closer to the file opening logic.

2. **PDF and POV Metadata:**
   - Implement support for writing filename metadata to PDF and POV files when operating in command-line mode.
   - Default the filename output for PDF export to `false` in command-line mode to facilitate easier testing.

3. **AppImage Initialization Issue:**
   - Address the break in file lookup in AppImages due to undefined `OPENSCAD_QTGUI`.
   - Investigate the inclusion of `QSettingsCached.h` guarded by `OPENSCAD_NOGUI`, which affects the definition of `OPENSCAD_QTGUI`.
   - Ensure AppImage uses `boost` based `PlatformUtils::registerApplicationPath()` instead of default paths that fail due to AppRun initialization.
   - Validate with AppImage path like `./OpenSCAD-2024.10.24.ai21003-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-mount`.

4. **AppImage Path Fix:**
   - Incorporate AppImage specific lookup path as per #5392 to fix AppImage startup issues.
   - Decide between fully adopting the `boost` solution or reintegrating necessary Qt code while minimizing its usage in common initialization.

5. **User Feedback Analysis:**
   - Evaluate the need for rendering the full path of the `.scad` filename into the resulting PDF, based on utility and previous use-case scenarios.
