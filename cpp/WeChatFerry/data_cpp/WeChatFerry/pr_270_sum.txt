### Instruction to Programmer:

Update the `GetAppMsgMgr` offset to the correct value. The offset before this update could still send files, but the newly submitted offset is the correct one. Debugging indicates that the `SendFileMessage()` function executes completely and files are sent successfully. The error occurs during the stack release phase when exiting the function, suggesting a potential issue unrelated to the offset itself. Consider examining the stack release process and address the error possibly caused by multiple release attempts.
