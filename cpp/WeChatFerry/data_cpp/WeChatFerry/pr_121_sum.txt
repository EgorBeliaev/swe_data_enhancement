**Instructions for Changes**: 

1. Implement the function `RefreshLoginQrcode`.
2. Ensure that when `RefreshLoginQrcode` is called:
   - If the user is currently on the last login account interface, the application should automatically switch to the QR code login interface.
   - If the user is already on the QR code interface, the QR code should be refreshed. 

This update enhances the login process by providing a seamless and efficient ability to switch and refresh the QR code login interface.
