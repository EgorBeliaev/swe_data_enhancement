**Instruction for Changes:**

Update the file existence check for paths containing Chinese characters on Windows platforms. Replace the current use of `fs::exists(path)` with `GetFileAttributesW` API to accurately determine the file's presence regardless of encoding issues. This change addresses the encoding problem where `fs::exists(path)` returns false for existing files with Chinese names.
