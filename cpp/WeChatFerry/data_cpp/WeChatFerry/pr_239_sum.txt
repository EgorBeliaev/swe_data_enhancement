**PR Summary:**

1. **Fix Launch Failure Due to Missing Logs Folder:**
   - Ensure the presence of the "logs" folder to prevent application startup failures.
  
2. **Add UTF-8 Compatibility:**
   - Introduce a configuration item for UTF-8 encoding to resolve compilation issues related to Unicode support.
   - Specifically, address the compile errors from `fmt/base.h` requiring `/utf-8` for Unicode support.

3. **DLL Compilation and Testing:**
   - Compilation and regeneration for the DLL (`spy.dll` and `sdk.dll`) have been tested successfully, with all functions compiled from scratch due to missing previous IPDB/IOBJ files.
   - Both `spy` and `sdk` projects have been successfully recompiled and the resulting DLLs have been copied to the release directory.

**Instructions to Implement:**

- Verify and create the "logs" directory if not present as part of the application setup process.
- Update the C++ project settings to include `/utf-8` as a compilation flag.
- Ensure the project settings for both `spy` and `sdk` are configured to handle full compilation in the absence of IPDB/IOBJ files and that the resulting binaries are copied correctly.

This PR addresses errors due to Unicode support and missing directory on startup, ensuring consistent builds across the repository.
