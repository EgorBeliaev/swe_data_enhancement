1. **BT Node Addition**: Implement a BT node that removes goals when the footprint cost is below a configurable threshold.
   
2. **Service Modification**: Change the `GetCost` service to `GetCosts` to handle multiple goals in a single request for efficiency.

3. **Code Updates**:
   - Fix `getCostCallback` to handle out-of-bounds scenarios when `use_footprint` is true.
   - Address `Codecov` feedback to ensure coverage for the 5 lines currently missing.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update the migration guide and configuration guide to reflect the change from `GetCost` to `GetCosts`.
   - Add the new BT node details to the plugins page.
   - Ensure all new parameters and features are documented and reflected in default configs and the tuning guide.

5. **Testing & Review**:
   - Conduct further manual testing, particularly focusing on different robot platforms (differential drive, omnidirectional).
   - Resolve any CI build failures or conflicts with the main branch.
   - Verify tests are adequate and encompass new functionalities, ensuring sufficient coverage as per `Codecov` recommendations.

6. **Future Considerations**:
   - Explore potential optimizations with STL vectors.
   - Consider removing redundancy in code by possibly implementing a utility function like `bool XYZ()`.
   - Investigate and address possible issue with turning near corners on omnidirectional platforms.
