**Instructions for Programmer:**

1. **Add Parameters:**
   - Implement `acceleration_limit` and `deceleration_limit` parameters for `DriveOnHeading` and `BackUp` behaviors.
   
2. **Documentation Update:**
   - Update default configurations and documentation to include the new parameters.

3. **Testing:**
   - Ensure tests for behaviors are updated, specifically `backup_tester.py` and `drive_tester.py`, to verify the acceleration limits.
   - Address the 12 lines of missing coverage in `nav2_behaviors/plugins/drive_on_heading.hpp`.

4. **Build and CI:**
   - Resolve build failures as indicated in CI outputs by potentially rebasing or pulling the latest changes from `main` to address any API changes.

5. **Miscellaneous:**
   - Ensure entries are made in the configuration guide and migration guide for the new parameters.
   - Submit a non-ABI/API breaking change PR for backporting to Jazzy/Humble post-approval.

6. **Feedback Resolution:**
   - Follow up on feedback regarding test coverage, specifically creating a unit/system test showcasing the acceleration limits.

By completing these steps, the PR changes will effectively be implemented and prepared for potential backporting.
