1. **Ensure the code compiles:** The PR is currently not compiling. Check for errors, potentially due to an API update in an upstream library. Rebase or pull the latest changes from `main`.

2. **Add test coverage:** Ensure the new feature or changes are covered by tests, as indicated by the need for test coverage.

3. **Consistency with existing code:** Make necessary adjustments to ensure that the implementation is consistent with the existing codebase.

4. **Publishing optimal trajectory:** The PR focuses on publishing the optimal trajectory as a `nav_msgs::msg::Path` message, which has been validated with 100% test coverage as per the Codecov report.

5. **CI Verification:** Address issues raised by the CI outputs, and rerun the CI tests after making changes to ensure successful builds.

6. **Finalize changes:** Iterations are acknowledged to be perfect at the end, pending the above steps.

Make sure that all the points above are addressed before the final approval of the PR.
