**Instruction to Programmer:**

- Correct the duplicated `else if` condition in the `StaticLayer` `costmap_2d` plugin within the callback function to enable dynamic changes to the `footprint_clearing_enabled` parameter.
- Verify that the specific line duplication occurs at lines 490 and 500, ensuring that the condition is updated to allow for the parameter to be set via the ros2 interface externally.
- Test the change by executing the command `ros2 param set /local_costmap/local_costmap obstacle_layer.footprint_clearing_enabled` with values `False` or `True` to confirm it enables/disables as expected.
