**Title:** Add acceleration limit consideration to avoid overshooting in RotationShimController

**Summary of Changes:**
- Implement deceleration behavior in `RotationShimController` using the `max_angular_accel` parameter.
- Ensure the controller manages acceleration and deceleration in relation to the target orientation to improve precision in rotational movements.

**Testing and Verification:**
- Confirm functionality with small `angular_disengage_threshold` values.
- Tested on own robot hardware with optimal behavior: accelerating to full rotational speed, decelerating near the target angle, and stopping with a small disengagement threshold.

**Documentation Updates:**
- Update parameter descriptions to reflect changes.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Consider adding an open-loop support as an optional, parameterized feature in a subsequent PR.

**Migration Guide:**
- Add a section detailing the new behavior and provide a GIF for clarity on how to utilize it effectively.

**Code Review and Merging:**
- Ensure new parameters are documented in the migration and tuning guides.
- Maintain consistent behavior with existing convention in controller implementations.

**Coverage:**
- Address the issue of 66.67% coverage, as identified by Codecov, ensuring all lines are covered before merging.

**Next Steps for Programmers:**
- Implement necessary changes to allow parameterization for open-loop integration if offered in subsequent work.
- Verify that all behavioral changes are accurately documented and displayed within repository guides.
