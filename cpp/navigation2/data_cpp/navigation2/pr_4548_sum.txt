### Instruction for Changes:

- **Null Pointer Check**: Ensure `computeControl()` method checks if `action_server_->get_current_goal()` returns a null pointer when the `action_server_` is inactive.
- **Testing Requirements**: Verify changes on either Ubuntu, MacOS, or Windows, and on platforms like Steve's Robot, Tally's gazebo simulation, or hardware Turtlebot.
- **Documentation**: Update any new parameters in the default configs and documentation.
- **Future Optimizations**: Consider potential improvements using STL vectors and address any code redundancy by potentially creating a helper function like `bool XYZ()`.
- **Testing and Documentation for Maintainers**: 
  - Ensure documentation reflects additions of new parameters.
  - Include significant changes in migration and tuning guides.
  - Verify new functions are adequately covered by test cases and documented with Doxygen.
  - Ensure new plugins, if any, are listed on the plugins page.
  - For Behavior Tree (BT) Nodes, update relevant indexes and documentation.
