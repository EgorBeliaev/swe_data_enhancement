### Instructions for Code Modifications:
1. **Iterative target pose selection**:
   - Implement iterative selection of control points by forward simulating the control law to check for collisions with the target pose.
  
2. **Collision checking for final rotation**:
   - Add collision checking to the `prefer_final_rotation` parameter. Ensure the controller attempts additional movement if collisions are detected.

3. **Parameter Adjustments**:
   - Replace `motion_target_dist` with `min_lookahead` and `max_lookahead`.
   - Rename `final_rotation` to `prefer_final_rotation`.
   - Replace `initial_rotation` and `initial_rotation_min_angle` with `initial_rotation_tolerance`. Ensure it does not conflict with `allow_backward`.
   - Add parameter `v_angular_min_in_place` to enable effective rotation commands.

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update documentation to reflect the changes in parameters (`min_lookahead`, `max_lookahead`, `prefer_final_rotation`, and others).

5. **Testing**:
   - Ensure the controller with new defaults is tested for stability and reduce wobble, especially in narrow corridors and docking settings.
   - Update tests to reflect parameter changes and validate `initial_rotation_tolerance` against compatibility conflicts.

6. **Parameter Defaults**:
   - Review and adjust default values for `k_phi`, `k_delta`, `beta`, `lambda`, and other related parameters to balance navigation stability and responsiveness.

7. **Maintain code coverage**:
   - Address uncovered lines, specifically in `graceful_controller.cpp` around line 212-216, as pointed out by code coverage reports.

### Issue Addressed:
The PR addresses the need for better control stability and jitter reduction in the `graceful_controller`. The changes improve target pose selection, collision checking during rotations, and overall parameter tuning for enhanced robot navigation, especially in non-circular and docking scenarios.
