**Instruction to the Programmer:**

Refactor and fix the Savitsky-Golay filter implementation within both the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller and the smoother module. Specifically, ensure all modified and coverable lines are fully covered by tests. There is a noted minor coverage drop in 'nav2_mppi_controller/tools/utils.hpp', from 97.95% to 97.20%, while 'nav2_smoother/src/savitzky_golay_smoother.cpp' maintains full coverage at 100%. Address these areas as needed. This update closes the issue tracked in https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/issues/4665.
