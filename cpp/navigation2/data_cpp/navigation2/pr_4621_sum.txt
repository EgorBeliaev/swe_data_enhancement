**Instructions for Implementing Changes:**

1. **Performance Improvement in MPPI Controller:**
   - Replace the `xtensor` library with the `Eigen` library for computation in the MPPI controller.
   - Ensure that performance is increased by 45-50% with footprint and critics enabled.

2. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Conduct comprehensive unit tests and system tests to ensure functionality remains correct.
   - Focus on ensuring that path and cost critics compute trajectories accurately without collisions.
   - Address any test failures, particularly focusing on system tests that consistently fail.

3. **Critics Improvement:**
   - Fix issues related to the `CostCritic` and `PathAlignCritic`, particularly on ARM platforms (e.g., Jetson AGX).
   - Ensure `strided_traj_cols` calculation is corrected by subtracting for the first column and adding in the end to prevent out-of-bounds errors.

4. **Documentation and Migration Guide:**
   - Add a migration guide entry on `docs.nav2.org` to reflect the changes, improvement metrics, and any breaking changes introduced.

5. **CI and Conflict Resolution:**
   - Resolve any merge conflicts with the main branch, specifically those introduced by changes to goal `pose` handling in the optimizer.
   - Update the `optimizer_benchmark` to align with any new API changes.

6. **Benchmarks and Performance Comparison:**
   - Conduct performance benchmarking on both x86 and ARM platforms, comparing results between using `xtensor` and `Eigen`.
   - Document CPU usage, controller execution time, and resource utilization for different configurations.

7. **Open Points for Follow-up:**
   - Consider reducing potential oscillations observed with `PathAlignCritic` by tuning parameters.
   - Evaluate necessity and impact of using `fast-math` compiler flag with `Eigen` for further optimizations.

8. **Future Contribution Areas:**
   - Explore new control algorithms or costmap layer improvements.
   - Consider projects related to improvements in MPPI, implementing AI-based costmap layers, or optimizing collision monitoring.

Please ensure that all changes are thoroughly reviewed and tested, particularly focusing on ARM platform compatibility and maintaining existing functionality while improving performance.
