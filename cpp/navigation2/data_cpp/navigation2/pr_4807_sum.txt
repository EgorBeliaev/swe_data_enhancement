The pull request (PR) titled "Fix trajectory generation bug in docking controller" addresses a specific issue in the trajectory generation for collision checking in the docking controller of the repository. The main changes include:

1. Replacement of a `for` loop with a `do-while` loop for trajectory generation, which now checks if the trajectory has reached the target distance rather than iterating until `projection_time_` is reached. This change eliminates unnecessary poses with the same position and different orientations.

2. Verification of the image illustrating improvements, where the 'Before' and 'After' states demonstrate the effectiveness of the fix.

3. No new AI-generated software is involved in these changes, maintaining current development practices.

4. Test coverage is complete, as confirmed by Codecov, with all modified and coverable lines covered, particularly in `nav2_docking/opennav_docking/src/controller.cpp`.

Programmers familiar with the repository and build systems should apply these changes to improve trajectory generation reliability in the docking controller, ensuring that trajectory target conditions are properly assessed and unnecessary computational overhead is avoided.
