This PR fixes the issue in the behavior tree action server logging mechanism. It ensures that the server logs the behavior tree execution result only after the result is prepared, preventing erroneous logging if an error occurs during result preparation. Test coverage confirms that all modified and coverable lines are sufficiently tested.
