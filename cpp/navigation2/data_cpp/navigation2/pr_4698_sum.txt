**Instructions Summary:**

- **Action Clients Addition:** Add missing action clients in the `destroy_node` function of `BasicNavigator` within `robot_navigator`. This change ensures that the `BasicNavigator` node completely releases its resources.

- **Testing:** Ensure changes are compatible and tested on Ubuntu-24.04 using a Devcontainer Docker setup.

- **Documentation Tasks for Maintainers:**
  - Verify any new parameters added are documented in `docs.nav2.org`.
  - Ensure significant changes are included in the migration guide.
  - Confirm changes to behaviors are reflected in the tuning guide.
  - Add Doxygen documentation for any new functions.
  - Ensure new features have adequate test coverage.
  - Update plugins documentation with any new plugins.
  - For BT Nodes, update the BT XML index, package readme, and library lists.

- **Future Considerations:** 
  - Potential optimizations in STL vectors.
  - Consider adding a function `bool XYZ()` to reduce redundancy.
  - Verify performance on varying robotic platforms, particularly omnidirectional platforms.

**Issue Fixed:**

The PR addresses resource release issues in the `BasicNavigator` node by adding necessary action clients, preventing incomplete node destruction.
