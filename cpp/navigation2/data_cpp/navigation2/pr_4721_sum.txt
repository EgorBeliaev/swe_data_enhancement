**Instructions for Programmer:**

1. **Add New Parameter:**  
   Incorporate a new dynamic parameter `rotate_to_heading_once` in the `Shim Controller`. When set to `True`, ensure it aligns the robot's heading with the path only once at the beginning.

2. **Implement Method:**  
   Create a method `bool RotationShimController::isGoalChanged(const nav_msgs::msg::Path & path)` to verify if the goal in a given path differs from the controller's current path. Return `true` if the current path is empty or the goal pose in the path changes.

3. **Update Documentation:**  
   - Note the new parameter in the Rotation Shim Controller's configuration guide.
   - Reflect the changes in the migration guide for users upgrading from prior versions.

4. **Fix Linting Issues:**  
   Resolve any remaining linting errors identified by `ament_cpplint` and `ament_uncrustify`.

5. **Complete DCO Sign-Offs:**  
   Ensure all commit sign-offs are compliant with DCO requirements.

6. **Test Coverage:**  
   Maintain test coverage, ensuring all modified lines are adequately covered.

7. **Verification by Codecov:**  
   Confirm that all coverable lines are tested, based on the Codecov report, though current verification indicates satisfactory coverage.

Ensure that these updates are reflected in the appropriate documentation and migration guides, per the maintainers' checklist.
