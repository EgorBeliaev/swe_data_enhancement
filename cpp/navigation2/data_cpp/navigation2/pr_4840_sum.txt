Fix the orientation filtering bug in global planners:

1. Modify the orientation comparison logic.
   - Instead of comparing orientations to zero, ensure all orientations in the middle of the plan are equal when transforming from the global frame to the local frame.

Note: Ensure that no new parameters require updates in documentation or significant changes need migration guidance, and verify that all new features have adequate test coverage.
