**Instructions for Code Improvements:**

1. Implement automatic fallback to the WARP driver if hardware (HW) creation fails.
2. Add HRESULT checks for both swap chain creation and the Present call to handle GPU driver crashes.
3. Ensure D3DCompile functions check HRESULT instead of relying on the shader pointer for error conditions.
4. Release memory of the shader blob when it is no longer needed.
