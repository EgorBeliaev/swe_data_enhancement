        "body": "This should increase performance of a blur shader.\r\nAlpha blending was really used only for sdf corner calculations. The weights for summing color does not really matter - as sum of weights adds to 1.0. So only actual alpha usage is from sdf.\r\n\r\nThis code changes blur behavior a bit. It does the blur only wherever corner alpha is >= 0.9. But I believe this should not be noticeable, as you're always drawing borders of a box on top of it, so any \"incorrectly\" blurred sdf corner pixels will be covered by the box border.\r\n\r\nCode includes  bugfix when calculating kernel weights for smaller than 1px blur size for my previous PR."
