Add functionality to display the current Git commit ID in the window title and fatal exception dialog. 

1. Implement a Git command within `build.bat` to retrieve the commit string.
2. Update the window title to include the commit ID.
3. Display the commit ID in fatal exception dialogs to help with debugging.
4. Ensure that if the Git command fails to run, the window title remains unchanged.
5. Allow users to customize the 'dirty' suffix using `--dirty=-mycustomsuffix`.
6. Ensure commit ID text in dialogs is formatted to be clickable within GitHub when copied.

This enhancement aids in debugging by providing additional context through the commit ID.
