The proposed changes in the PR involve updating how resources are handled and categorized for Direct3D. The modifications introduce a uniform `ResourceKind` to consolidate `Tex2DKind` and `BufferKind`, applying stricter usage rules. Specifically:

1. `Static`: Immutable resources, updated only at creation.
2. `Dynamic`: Allows occasional CPU updates via `UpdateSubresource`.
3. `Stream`: Permits frequent CPU updates via `Map/Unmap` (not currently utilized).

These changes address exceptions occurring due to unsupported `MapOnDefaultBuffers` on old machines or VM environments. The PR corrects usage settings, avoiding inappropriate `READ` and `WRITE` flags in buffer creation with `D3D11_USAGE_DEFAULT`, which caused failures. It ensures proper resource creation by setting usage to `D3D11_USAGE_DEFAULT` without access flags for specific scenarios, thus resolving issues like failed executions on outdated hardware or VM setups.
