Instruction for Programmer:

1. Implement functionality to get and set thread context for AVX-512 registers on 64-bit Windows target.
2. Correct the code for accessing xmm and ymm registers by ensuring 128-bit halves are not swapped.
3. Use `GetXStateFeaturesMask` correctly by placing its call after `GetThreadContext`.
4. Reconsider changes in `codeview.h` to potentially include zmm register enum values.
5. Update `rdi_format.h` file to include new zmm register enums, with 32 zmm registers expanding from 16 ymm registers.
6. Optimize the `SetThreadContext` method to modify and set only the ymm/zmm registers that have been changed, rather than setting all registers, to minimize context switch costs.

Optional Improvements:
- Consider grouping registers in SSE, AVX, and AVX-512 categories in the `Registers` view.
- Implement logic to hide unsupported registers on the target CPU.
