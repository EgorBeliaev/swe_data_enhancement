**Instruction/Description:**

Simplify the handling of `WM_NCCALCSIZE` and `WM_NCHITTEST` messages to improve window resizing behavior and style. Ensure that window drop shadows appear correctly. Adjust the resize areas to extend out over the client area similarly to native Windows apps, except for the top resize which should extend into the client area. Testing shows no issues, but Windows API behavior can vary. Review the resizing and shadow behavior with the provided video demonstration.
