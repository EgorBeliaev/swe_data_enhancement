**Instruction to Programmer:**

1. **Disable Alpha Blending**: Modify the blur shader by turning off alpha blending. This is primarily for performance enhancement.

2. **Blur Behavior Adjustment**: Change the blur effect to only occur where the corner alpha value is greater than or equal to 0.9. This minor change should not affect visibility as box borders typically overlay the blurred areas.

3. **Bug Fix**: Correct the kernel weights calculation for blur sizes smaller than 1px as per the previous PR.
