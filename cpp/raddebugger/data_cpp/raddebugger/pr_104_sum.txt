**Instructions for Shader Performance Improvements:**

1. **UI Rect Shader:**
   - Transfer color and `sdf_sample_pos` calculation to the vertex shader.
   - Utilize the hardware rasterizer for interpolation instead of manual arithmetic.
   - Aim to minimize the number of varyings.

2. **Blur Shader:**
   - Implement bilinear sampling for texture samples.
   - Utilize hardware bilinear lerp to read two pixels in a single sample operation.
   - Adjust weights to maintain consistent blurring effects.

3. **General Enhancements:**
   - Apply minor math simplifications in vertex shaders.
