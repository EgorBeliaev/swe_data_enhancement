        "body": "_[Sponsors: Klara, Inc., Wasabi Technology, Inc.]_\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n\r\n\"no-op\" injections (#16085) simply make the op succeed, entirely bypassing the vdev stages, including queuing and error assessment. This makes it useless for testing those things in conjunction with its original purpose: simulating a failure between a device cache and its permanent store.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMove the injection down, making it the last thing to happen after the IO is dequeued and the device health is checked. Then, don't bypass the vdev stages anymore; instead, let it proceed to VDEV_IO_DONE where it can be properly counted and disaggregated by the queue and any followup processing can occur. \r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nMostly internal testing with some new queue functionality. We have no specific tests for no-op in the test suite, though I've run the `zinject` suite to success as some sort of sanity.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Performance enhancement (non-breaking change which improves efficiency)\r\n- [ ] Code cleanup (non-breaking change which makes code smaller or more readable)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] Library ABI change (libzfs, libzfs\\_core, libnvpair, libuutil and libzfsbootenv)\r\n- [ ] Documentation (a change to man pages or other documentation)\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the OpenZFS [code style requirements](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-conventions).\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [x] I have read the [**contributing** document](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [ ] I have added [tests](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/tree/master/tests) to cover my changes.\r\n- [x] I have run the ZFS Test Suite with this change applied.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are properly formatted and contain [`Signed-off-by`](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#signed-off-by).\r\n"
