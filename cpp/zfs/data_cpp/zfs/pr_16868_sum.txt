**Instruction:**

- Ensure that `rra` is not dereferenced after the last `zio_nowait()` call in RAIDZ expansion logic to prevent use-after-free vulnerabilities. This is critical as ASAN in `ztest` has detected this issue.

**Additional Notes:**

- This PR serves as a bug fix, aligning with the code style requirements of OpenZFS.
- No new features, performance enhancements, code cleanup, breaking changes, or library ABI changes are included.
- The checklist confirms adherence to code style, and commits are formatted with the required `Signed-off-by`. However, documentation updates, tests, and the ZFS Test Suite validation are outstanding in the PR.
