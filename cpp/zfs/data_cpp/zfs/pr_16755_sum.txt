### Instructions for Programmer:

1. Extend the `dump_ddt()` function to display additional container configuration details, including the version, flags, and logger attributes for deduplication tables.

2. Modify the command outputs for `zdb -D tank` by including details such as version, flags, root object, and deduplication table statistics for both duplicate and unique entries as demonstrated in the provided examples.

3. Update all byte values (`len`, `dspace`, and `mspace`) in the outputs to use decimal representation.

4. Ensure code complies with OpenZFS code style requirements.

5. Reformat any unsigned integer printing to use `PRIu64` instead of `%lu` or `%llu` to accommodate differences between user and kernel space formatting on Linux.

6. Check and adjust the implementation to ensure compatibility for both user and kernel space builds, with particular attention to the representation of `uint64_t`.

### Note:
- This update is a new feature addition and requires careful checking to maintain compatibility across different build environments.
- Ensure all commit messages are signed correctly as per project guidelines.
