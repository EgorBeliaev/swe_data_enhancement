        "body": "Small block workloads may use a very large number of dirty records. During simple block cloning test due to BRT still using 4KB blocks I can easily see up to 2.5M of those used.  Before this change dbuf_dirty_record_t structures representing them were allocated via kmem_zalloc(), that rounded their size up to 512 bytes.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of specialized kmem cache allows to reduce the size from 512 to 408 bytes.  Additionally, since override and raw params in dirty records are mutually exclusive, puting them into a union allows to reduce structure size down to 368 bytes, increasing the saving to 28%, that can be a 0.5GB or more of RAM.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n```\r\n# vmstat -z | egrep 'buf_dirty|ITEM'\r\nITEM                   SIZE   LIMIT     USED     FREE      REQ FAIL SLEEP XDOM\r\ndbuf_dirty_record_t:    368,      0, 2762184,    5933, 8828560,   0,   0,   0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
