**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. Implement the platform-independent portions of block cloning for the zvol block device in OpenZFS.
2. Note that this implementation does not introduce new functionality directly into OpenZFS but prepares for Clone Range replay functionality, benefiting systems using TrueNAS kernel patches.
3. Ensure all code adheres to OpenZFS code style requirements.
4. Validate the changes through CI testing as part of the integration process.
5. Focus code updates on the platform-independent aspects, following the upstream effort for block cloning.

The PR does not specify changes to test cases or documentation updates, so these are not required at this time.
