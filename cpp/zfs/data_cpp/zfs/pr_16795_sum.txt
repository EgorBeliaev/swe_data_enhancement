### PR Instructions

1. **Bug Fix**: Address the VERIFY trip issue when logging occurs after the final transaction group (txg) is set, which leads to a panic in `dbuf_dirty()`. This is a bug fix that doesn't introduce new functionality.

2. **Logging Adjustment**: Use `ASSERT()` in place of `VERIFY()` for logging checks when logging is requested. This should help catch issues during debugging without impacting production environments. Include the operation and format in the log message for better diagnostics:
   - Format: `"Logged after final txg was set: %s %s"`

3. **Code Duplication**: Duplicate the assertion in `spa_history_log_nvl()` to ensure consistency across different logging paths.

4. **Remove Unnecessary Changes**: Avoid adding empty lines before `if (err) {` or similar code that does not contribute to the fix to maintain code cleanliness.

5. **Collaboration**: Coordinate with author `amotin` for contributions on this change and mark them accordingly if applicable.

6. **Testing and Validation**: Re-run the test suite on the latest master to confirm fixes are effective, especially for any potentially related issues as indicated by the logs shared in the discussions. Push updates regularly for feedback and validation.
