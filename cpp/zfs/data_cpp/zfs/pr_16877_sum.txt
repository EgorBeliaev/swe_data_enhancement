**Instructions:**

1. **Modify Iteration Logic for Share Properties**:
   - Skip iterating over snapshots when setting `sharenfs` or `sharesmb` properties for datasets.
   - Instead, iterate over all child datasets and their children for share properties, as snapshots themselves do not require changes in share properties.

2. **Performance Enhancement**:
   - This change is a performance enhancement, significantly reducing the overhead in scenarios with a large number of snapshots.

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Ensure that accessing the snapshots over shares with the new iteration logic does not change the behavior when share properties are set on datasets or their child datasets.

4. **Compliance and Best Practices**:
   - The code must follow the OpenZFS code style requirements.
   - It is essential to read the OpenZFS contributing document.
   - Run the ZFS Test Suite to validate that the changes do not introduce new issues.

5. **Commit Message**:
   - Ensure all commit messages are properly formatted and include the `Signed-off-by` notation as per the contribution guidelines.

These instructions optimize the handling of share properties on large dataset hierarchies and are critical for the performance improvements intended by this pull request.
