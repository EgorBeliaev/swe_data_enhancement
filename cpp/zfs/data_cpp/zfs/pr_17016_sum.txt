**Instruction to Programmer:**

1. **Objective**: Fix an increment race condition in `zio_notify_parent()` related to the parent zios during the resume from suspension process.
   
2. **Problem**: When zios are reexecuted after suspension, an increment race can occur if parent zios have active children transitioning through READY or DONE states. This can cause wait count inconsistencies due to missing locks.

3. **Solution**: Implement locks on parent zios in `zio_reexecute()` to ensure that wait counts are safely incremented without races.

4. **Testing**: The fix has been tested using a full ZFS Test Suite (ZTS) run and extensive local stress tests where the environment resumed from pool suspension around every 5-10 minutes without any incidents observed for ~13 hours.

5. **Changes Required**:
   - Ensure that `zio_reexecute()` takes appropriate zio locks before updating the wait counts of parent zios.

6. **Considerations**:
   - The fix aims for correctness over performance, considering that `zio_reexecute()` is not a frequent pathâ€”it's mostly triggered during pool suspension recurrence and IO retry, where stability is prioritized over performance.

The issue addressed by this PR is ensuring data integrity during zio tree reexecution by managing concurrency through proper locking, preventing early dereferencing in multi-threaded environments.
