Title: Add missing `zfs_exit()` when snapdir is disabled

Instruction: Implement a bug fix to ensure that `zfs_vget` calls `zfs_exit` when it encounters an error due to a disabled snapdir. This fix should be a non-breaking change. The existing issue does not involve adding new features, performance enhancements, code cleanup, or a breaking/library ABI change. Ensure compliance with the OpenZFS code style requirements, update documentation where necessary, and consider adding appropriate tests to validate the change. Run the ZFS Test Suite to verify that no other areas of the code are adversely affected. Ensure all commit messages are properly formatted and include the necessary `Signed-off-by` notation.
