Title: Fix regression in dmu_buf_will_fill()

Issue: Incorrect condition for calling `dbuf_undirty()` caused a regression where blocks not dirty in the current TXG but still in `DB_NOFILL` state were not reverting to `DB_UNCACHED`, leading to a NULL de-reference error on accessing absent `db_data`. 

Instructions:
1. Modify the condition within `dmu_buf_will_fill()` to ensure that `dbuf_undirty()` is correctly called for blocks no longer dirty in the TXG, regardless of `DB_NOFILL` state.
2. Add assertions for `db_data` to assist in debugging.
