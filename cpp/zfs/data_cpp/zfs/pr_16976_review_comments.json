        "body": "The flag VFCF_FILEREV was recently defined in FreeBSD so that a file system could indicate that it increments va_filerev by one for each change.\r\n\r\nSince ZFS does do this, set the flag if defined for the kernel being built.  This allows the NFSv4.2 server to reply with the correct change_attr_type attribute value.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\nFreeBSD has a recently created file system flag called VFCF_FILEREV that indicates\r\nthat the file system increments va_filerev by one for each change.  This flag is used\r\nby the FreeBSD NFSv4.2 server to return the correct value for the change_attr_type\r\nNFSv4.2 attribute.\r\n\r\nSince ZFS does increment va_filerev by one, set the flag.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nSet the VFCF_FILEREV flag, if it is defined.\r\nThe #ifdef was changed so that it handles multiple flags that might be defined\r\nin the FreeBSD kernel.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested in a FreeBSD system running a NFSv4.2 server and exporting a ZFS file system.\r\nA packet trace showed that the correct value for change_attr_type was returned to\r\nthe client for a NFSv4.2 mount.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
