### Instructions for the Programmer:

1. **Enhance Speculative Prefetching**:
   - Implement prescient prefetches for demand indirect blocks, especially after the first block. This optimization aims to support block cloning due to larger access sizes.

2. **Increase Prefetch Distance**:
   - Modify the maximum prefetch distance for indirect blocks from 64MB to 128MB to accommodate cloning access sizes, assuming a default 128KB record size.

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - The patch has been tested by cloning 200 files in an HDD pool, demonstrating a reduction in cloning time by half (from 9 to 4.5 seconds), where 63% of prefetch reads complete before demand.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Classify these changes as performance enhancements to reduce `dbuf_hold()` sync read delays in `dmu_buf_hold_array_by_dnode()`.

5. **Checklist Compliance**:
   - Ensure code follows the OpenZFS code style.
   - Validate that all commit messages are properly formatted and contain the `Signed-off-by` indication.
