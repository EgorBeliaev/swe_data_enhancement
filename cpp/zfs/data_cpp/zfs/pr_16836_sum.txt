**Instruction for Repository Changes:**

1. **Change Overview**: Modify `dsl_deadlist_open()` to return errors instead of causing kernel panics. This change specifically targets scenarios like `dsl_dataset_hold_obj()`, where handling errors gracefully is preferred.

2. **Error Handling**: Ensure that in cases of pool corruption, the failure to hold a dataset does not lead to kernel panic but rather a manageable error return. This is expected to make the system behavior more user-friendly in such events.

3. **Testing and Validation**: Note that the changes have not been extensively tested. Any further modifications should include rigorous testing to verify that the error handling operates as intended without causing regressions.

4. **Code Style Compliance**: Ensure all modifications adhere to the OpenZFS code style requirements as per the repository's contributing guidelines.

5. **Commit Messages**: Ensure all commit messages are properly formatted and include a `Signed-off-by` line.

6. **Documentation and Testing**: Consider adding or updating documentation and tests to reflect these changes, even though these tasks were not marked as completed in the PR checklist.
