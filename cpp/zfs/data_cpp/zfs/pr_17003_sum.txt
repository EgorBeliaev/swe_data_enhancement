The pull request introduces new kstats to track gang allocations in ZFS. Here are the changes and considerations based on the discussion:

1. **Add New kstats**: 
   - Implement two new kstats: number of gang fallbacks and number of multi-level gang fallbacks to improve observability into gang block usage.

2. **Naming and Existing Counters**:
   - Re-evaluate naming conventions like `ziostat.normal_fallbacks` as they may not clearly indicate allocation-related metrics.
   - Consider integration or consistency with existing allocation paths and counters, particularly for ZIL and metaslab allocation-related counters.

3. **Style and Commit Message**:
   - Fix any style errors present in the code.
   - Ensure commit messages conform to the requirements, particularly the limitation of line length to 72 characters or less. 

This PR is a non-breaking change, introducing a new feature without altering existing functionality.
