        "body": "In some cases like dsl_dataset_hold_obj() it is possible to handle those errors, so failure to hold dataset should be better than kernel panic.  Some other places where these errors are still not handled but asserted should be less dangerous just as unreachable.\r\n\r\nWe have a user report about pool corruption leading to assertions on these errors.  Hopefully this will make behavior a bit nicer.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nNot really.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
