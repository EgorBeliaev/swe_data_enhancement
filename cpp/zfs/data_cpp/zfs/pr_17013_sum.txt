### Instructions for Changes:

1. **Objective**: Optimize prefetch performance by eliminating unnecessary transform operations on the ARC buffer, reducing CPU usage and improving read performance.

2. **Implementation**:
   - Focus on utilizing the existing flag to prevent unnecessary buffer allocation and transformation operations during prefetch.
   - Ensure the flag to avoid operations on the ARC buffer is correctly assigned when zio retrieves data from Disk to ARC.

3. **Testing Setup**:
   - Tested on Ubuntu 23.10 with kernel 6.5.0 on Intel Xeon Gold 6342 CPU.
   - OpenZFS version used: 2.2.6.
   - Environment: 6 NVMe drives (1TB each) configured in RAID0 with a 128k record size.
   - Tested with IOR benchmarking tool.
   - ZFS configuration: Primarycache set to 'all', compression enabled (lz4), checksum enabled, and zfs_compressed_arc_enabled set to 1.

4. **Commit Requirements**:
   - Adhere to OpenZFS code style.
   - Ensure commit messages are concise and appropriate for single-line brevity.
   - Remove any unnecessary merge commits; ensure there is only one clean commit in the PR.

5. **PR Handling**:
   - Address all style guide recommendations, ensuring changes are properly documented and signed-off.
   - Collaboration needed for final merge as only select users have the required permissions.

This PR addresses the performance degradation issue (openzfs/zfs#17008) by optimizing the usage of prefetch in ZFS to avoid redundant operations.
