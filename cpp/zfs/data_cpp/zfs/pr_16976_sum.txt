Add the VFCF_FILEREV flag definition for FreeBSD in the repository:

1. **Set the VFCF_FILEREV flag:**
   - Check if VFCF_FILEREV is defined in the FreeBSD kernel.
   - If defined, mark it in the ZFS filesystem to indicate va_filerev increment by one on changes. 

2. **Modify #ifdef conditions:**
   - Update the preprocessor directive to handle multiple flags that might be defined in the FreeBSD kernel (`#ifdef`).

3. **Test in environment:**
   - Ensure the functionality is tested in a FreeBSD system running an NFSv4.2 server exporting a ZFS file system.
   - Validate correct change_attr_type value for a NFSv4.2 mount via packet trace.

4. **Ensure code style and standards:**
   - Follow the OpenZFS code style requirements.
   - Ensure all commit messages are properly formatted and place "Signed-off-by" line at the end of the commit message. Amend and push changes if necessary.

5. **Type of changes:**
   - Implement as a new feature and code cleanup, ensuring no breaking changes occur.

Note: The documentation has not been updated, and tests have not been added. Run the ZFS Test Suite and ensure compliance with the checklist if possible.
