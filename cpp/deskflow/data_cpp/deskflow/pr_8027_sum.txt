**Instruction for Implementation:**

1. **Single Instance Implementation:**
   - Restrict the deskflow GUI to allow only a single instance to run at any time. 
   - Implement functionality such that if the GUI is already running in the background, any attempt to open a new instance should bring the current instance to the foreground. This should function without reliance on system tray support, resolving issues where tray icons are not available.

2. **Addressed Issues:**
   - This PR addresses and resolves issues #7975 and #5304 related to GUI instance management without relying on tray icons.

3. **Naming Convention Review:**
   - Consider altering the shared memory and socket naming convention from "dfGui" to "deskflow" for clarity and consistency with the binary name which is also 'deskflow'.

4. **Testing Validation:**
   - Ensure the implementation passes the following test cases across different operating systems:
     - **Mac OS**:
       - Restore the GUI when minimized, hidden, or closed.
       - Note that restoring from a closed state may require changes from another PR: #8034.
     - **Linux (Wayland)**:
       - Restore behavior can't rely on all desktop environments due to Wayland limitations; some environments may only flash an icon to highlight the window.
     - **Linux (X11)**:
       - Ensure restoration works when the window is minimized, hidden, or closed.
     - **Windows**:
       - Confirm the GUI restores successfully when minimized, hidden, or closed.

By following the outlined specifications, you will ensure the application maintains a single running instance, mitigate issues with system tray dependencies, and improve consistency in naming conventions.
