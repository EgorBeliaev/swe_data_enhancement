**Instruction:**

Refactor the logging system to utilize the correct log level for failure messages. This will enhance the visibility of everyday problems that are currently being missed by not using the debug log level. Be aware that this change might increase log noise, and be prepared to adjust by downgrading log levels for messages that are too noisy, not helpful, or incorrectly flagged as failures/warnings in the future.
