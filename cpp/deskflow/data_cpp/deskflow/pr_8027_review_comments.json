One of the suggestions was that synergy use a Switchboard plug (an entry in the elementary OS settings panel)\n\nIdeally, you would change your UI to be in accordance with the [GNOME guidelines](https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Whiteboards/StatusIcons/Guidelines) or the [elementary OS guidelines](https://elementary.io/docs/human-interface-guidelines).\n\nI will be able to help with this issue in about a month time. If the decision is made to ignore it, I will fork synergy's UI.\n\nThere seems to be a pull request similar to this issue: https://github.com/symless/synergy/pull/4194\n",

The application can be closed, it runs in the background, but it's just not possible to see/reopen it via the tray icon.\r\n\r\nSo the solution GNOME advises is to use proper APIs and stuff for it. E.g. music players can use a direct API and have stuff in the notification, file sharing services can use libcloudproviders and have direct integration intro Nautilus.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, your place would possibly best in the settings for \"displays\" in GNOME. However, there you have to advocate to GNOME to add appropriate APIs.\r\n\r\nFYI, here are how other's solved this issue:\r\n* https://github.com/nextcloud/client_theming/issues/173\r\n* https://github.com/nitroshare/nitroshare-desktop/issues/204 (there are more links to resources in there)\r\n* https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues/3830\r\n* \u2026\r\n\r\nA good workaround for now is to use [the TopIcons Plus GNOME extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1031/topicons/) which brings back these icons for now."

Don't close your window.\r\n```\r\nSynergy does work though, I just had no icon.\r\nWhen I started synergy manually, it worked without issues, no error message and I got a system tray icon. So I was wondering and found out, that if you delay the start of synergy a bit, it works.\r\nSo I added this line to my `~/.config/autostart/synergy.desktop` file:\r\n```\r\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=5\r\n```\r\nAnd the issue is gone."
