## Instructions for Implementing PR Changes

1. **Expose Update Check Option in Settings:**
   - Add a checkbox in the application settings dialog to allow users to enable or disable the update check feature.
   - Ensure the check update toggle interacts correctly with the `AppConfig` object within `SettingsDialog`.

2. **Update `SettingsDialog` UI:**
   - Fix issues within the `SettingsDialog` UI files that generate invalid alignment values when the form is edited.

3. **Ensure Proper Initial Configuration:**
   - Resolve an issue where the initial setting for auto-update may not be set at application startup.
   - Incorporate direct usage of the `AppConfig` object to handle update check settings.

4. **Bug Fixes & Improvements:**
   - Address a bug in `MainWindow.cpp`: Make a modification at the line where the update check option is prompted to ensure settings are saved after the dialog is dismissed.
   - Save the configuration settings explicitly with `m_ConfigScopes.save()`, enhancing persistence (critical change provided in diff format).

5. **Dependencies & Related Fixes:**
   - Recommend ensuring that PR #7897 lands before or simultaneously with this PR to mitigate confusion due to Bug #7896.
   - Although it’s suggested that this PR can proceed first if #7897 isn’t approved yet, consider orchestration of release strategy based on priority.

6. **Additional Configuration Fixes (Pre-existing Issues):**
   - Clear settings and ensure GUI restarts without reprising the "check update" prompt.
   - Validate that the `enableUpdateCheck` setting correctly updates the configuration file (`Deskflow.conf`) to reflect the user's choice.
   - Address related issue of GUI process hanging upon clearing settings, as per related issue discussions.

These instructions should streamline the development updates and bug fixes encapsulated within the existing pull request, specifically enhancing user control over update notifications and stabilizing configuration settings management within the GUI application.
