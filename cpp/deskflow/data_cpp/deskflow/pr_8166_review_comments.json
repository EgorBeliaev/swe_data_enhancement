        "body": "> * Dont use `on` names\r\n\r\nAre you sure you don't want to use a prefix for slot function names? Many projects use `on`, `handle`, or `slot` prefixes. This helps developers quickly understand the intent of the function and prevents accidental misuse of slots as regular functions. I have often seen people mistakenly use a slot as a regular function, which is easily missed in code reviews.\r\n\r\nExamples with prefixes:\r\n- KWin: [`slotWindowAdded`](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/blob/master/src/plugins/backgroundcontrast/contrast.cpp#L69)\r\n- Plasma: [`onPagerItemSizeChanged`](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/blob/master/applets/pager/windowmodel.h#L32)\r\n- Telegram: [`onInit`](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/blob/bf48025d12fcbdda60b29c932cd7e22b37c6fd2f/Telegram/SourceFiles/media/audio/media_audio.h#L340)\r\n\r\nPlease update the [code style](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/wiki/Code-Style) with the slot naming convention."
