**Instructions to Programmer:**

1. **Naming Conventions**: Do not use the `on` prefix for slot function names as it may lead to confusion with auto connections, which the team aims to avoid.
   
2. **Avoiding Lambdas**: Do not use lambdas for items that are directly connectable; instead, ensure they conform to the existing naming conventions and styles within the project.
