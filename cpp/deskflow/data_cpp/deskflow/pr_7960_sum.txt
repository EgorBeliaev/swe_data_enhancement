The PR proposes moving away from using clipboard viewer windows for clipboard monitoring on Windows, which is outdated and can result in message processing failures.

The new approach involves accessing the Windows clipboard through newer APIs, offering improved stability and performance, verified by successful cross-OS clipboard operations over multiple days.
