**Instructions for Programmer:**

1. **Change Type**: Modify code logic.
2. **Modification Details**: Replace the current `assert` statement with a `warning` message in the `switchScreen` function located in `Server.cpp`.
3. **File Location**: `/home/nick/Projects/deskflow/src/lib/server/Server.cpp`
4. **Line Location**: Line 435 in `Server::switchScreen` function.
5. **Issue Reference**: This is addressing the issue mentioned in the repository with the title "Assert hit in `Server::switchScreen`".
6. **Operating System Consideration**: The issue primarily occurs on Linux (Wayland environment) as highlighted by the original issue reporter.
7. **Logging Improvement**: Optionally, add enhanced logging to provide better clarity and information about the boundary conditions being checked, especially around mouse event handling when switching screens.

**Note**: The assert statement is causing a failure due to the boundary check conditions. The transition to a warning will help bypass abrupt assertion failures while still alerting the developer through logs.
