**Instruction:**

1. **Fix Keyboard Layout Detection**: Ensure that if the keyboard layout variant is missing, a default value should be set to correctly detect the local language. This fix addresses the issue of failing to populate local languages when the keyboard layout or variant list has errors.

2. **Update to Linear History**: Before merging, rebasing is required to maintain a linear history. Ensure you do not use merge options. If the option 'Rebase Branch' is available in the web interface, you may utilize it for updating the branch.

The provided patch successfully changes logs where previously local languages remained empty due to errors in the keyboard layout detection process, as evidenced by successfully detecting local languages (zh, en) after the code changes.
