### Instructions for Implementing 'Proper Hide to Tray' in the Repository

1. **Modify `MainWindow::CloseEvent`:** 
   - Adjust the logic to clearly distinguish between the actions for "quitting" and "hiding" the application. This should result in cleaner and more understandable code.

2. **Code Simplification:**
   - Refactor the existing codebase related to hiding and quitting functionality to enhance simplicity and maintainability.

3. **Remove Unnecessary Slot:**
   - Eliminate the `MainWindow::onAppAboutToQuit` slot as it is deemed unneeded for the current functionality.

4. **Utilize macOS Native Hide Functionality:**
   - Implement native macOS methods to "hide to tray," enhancing native support for this feature.

These changes aim to resolve any confusion between quitting and hiding behaviours in the application, thereby streamlining the related code and functionality.
