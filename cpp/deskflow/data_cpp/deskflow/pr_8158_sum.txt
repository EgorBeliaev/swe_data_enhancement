**Instruction for Changes:**

1. **Commit Message Standards**: Update your commit message to start with the prefix "fix:" as per the project's Code Standards.

2. **Copyright Information**: Ensure that you update the copyright information on the files you have edited, especially if the changes are non-trivial, to adhere to the REUSE compliance.

3. **PR Description**: Incorporate the necessary testing checkboxes within the PR description to include both GNOME and KDE desktop environments. If other desktop environments like Hyprland are used, add additional checkboxes.

4. **Code Implementation**: Ensure that the `options` argument is correctly captured, as the current issue involves calling a method (`cb_disabled`) on a GVariant* instead of a PortalInputCapture*. This is intended to address improper handling of deactivated signals, which may fix related issues such as #8147 involving screen size changes and transitioning on Wayland servers.

5. **Testing**: Further testing is required on Hyprland, as indicated by a team member. Also, document any additional environment tests to validate the fix and determine if the issue is specific to GNOME or other desktop environments.

**Issue Description:**

The PR aims to correct the missing options argument in a method call, which results in `cb_disabled` being invoked incorrectly. In environments such as GNOME when the screen size changes, the lack of proper signal handling causes stalls or interruptions in screen transitions. This fix is believed to address related issues, notably #8147, although initial testing on GNOME indicates it does not completely resolve the problem, highlighting potential issues with GNOME portals.
