The Address i see in the firewall is dll7xpq8c5ev0.cloudfront.net\r\nPlease add an option to disable the update check.\r\nThanks!",

Windows users typically prefer to install the `.msi` direct in my experience, despite package managers being available. Therefore, the majority of Deskflow users are likely to benefit greatly from an update check.\r\n\r\nAlso, the update pop-up is designed to appear once at startup, so it\u2019s designed to be unobtrusive rather than a nag.
