Using Fedora 40 RPMs downloaded from github.com/deskflow/deskflow.\r\nUK keyboard, KDE region settings are for UK.\r\n\r\n### Deskflow configuration\r\n\r\nTwo Fedora 40 systems. The deskflow server is a laptop with an external display attached (so two screens for the server). The client is a tower with a single display attached. Connecting over a direct cat-5 cable between the two machines, with manually assigned IP addresses.\r\n\r\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nStart Deskflow on both systems, click \"Allow\" in \"Input capture requested\" and \"Remote control requested\" dialogs. Move mouse from server to client and type using the server's keyboard. All letters typed are uppercase. Holding Shift doesn't change anything. Turning caps lock on doesn't change it.\r\n\r\nOther characters are wrong too:\r\nTyping `[` enters `8` on the client, `]` enters `9`, backslash enters `-` and `|` enters `\u00ac`\r\n\r\nThis doesn't always happen. After rebooting both systems and restarting deskflow it seems to be OK again for a while. Once it starts happening, no amount of restarting deskflow on server and client helps, nor does logging out of KDE on the client and logging in again and restarting deskflow.\r\n\r\nAnything typed directly on the keyboard connected to the server works as normal, only characters typed on the server's keyboard and shared with the client via deskflow are incorrect.\r\n\r\n### Log

Toggling it doesn't change the odd behaviour on the client.\r\n\r\nI never had this problem with Synergy on X11, it's only with deskflow on Wayland (although I've also upgraded from Fedora 39 to Fedora 40 in that time, so several things have changed, and I can't revert to X11 to test if it still happens with synergy on Fedora 40).\r\n\r\nI've just rebooted the client machine and started Deskflow, and noticed that sending `[` and `]` from the server machine's keyboard _always_ types `8` and `9`, even after just rebooting.
