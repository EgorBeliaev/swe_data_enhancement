The issue being addressed in this pull request is that the `qDebug()` function does not work on Fedora due to the `QT_LOGGING_RULES` variable being set in a way that disables `qDebug()`. The proposed change is to override `QT_LOGGING_RULES` using an existing environment variable, `DESKFLOW_GUI_DEBUG`, to enable debug logging. However, after the update, the solution did not work and the original workaround was restored.
