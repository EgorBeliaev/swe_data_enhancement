### Instructions for Modifications:

1. **Keymap Loading Fix**: Ensure the keymap file for the Ei backend is properly reset to start before reading. This prevents the fallback to a default US-keymap on certain systems.

2. **LOG Severity Update**: Change the logging level from `LOG_DEBUG` to `LOG_WARNING` in `src/lib/platform/EiKeyState.cpp`, as the issue may be too subtle to be caught in debug messages, yet it is non-fatal.

### Description of the Issue:

The PR addresses a problem where the keymap file in use by the Ei backend is improperly read, resulting in defaulting to a US keymap. This issue occurs due to the file position not being correctly set at the start, causing read failures or zero bytes being read. Additionally, it affects interaction with KDE clients and fixes an issue where everything typed appears in all caps on Wayland (#7886), alongside other key mapping inconsistencies on the client-side like `[`, `]` translating to incorrect characters.
