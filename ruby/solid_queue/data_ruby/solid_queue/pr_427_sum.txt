**Condensed Instructions:**

1. Expand the check in `supervisor.rb` to validate the configuration by checking `configuration.valid?`.
2. If the configuration is invalid, abort and print the existing errors.
3. Integrate this validation to run before starting the supervisor, rather than waiting until the scheduling phase.
4. Ensure that recurring jobs provide feedback on validation errors when invalid job classes are listed, as this is currently missing.
5. Consider incorporating a general configuration validation for recurring tasks and the overall configuration, as previously discussed.
