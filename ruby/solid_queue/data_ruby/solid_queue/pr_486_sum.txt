**Instruction for Changes:**

Implement lifecycle hooks in both the Dispatcher and Scheduler components to facilitate post-fork and pre-stop actions. Specifically, add `on_*_start` and `on_*_stop` hooks to accommodate Rails Semantic Logger requirements in forking scenarios, allowing execution of `post_fork_action` during start and `pre_stop_action` during stop processes.
