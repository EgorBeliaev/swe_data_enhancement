**Change Instructions:**

- **Delete Old Recurring Tasks**: Ensure that when a recurring task's key changes or the task is removed from `recurring.yml`, the old tasks are automatically deleted from the database. This prevents outdated tasks from continuing to run.
  
- **Release Update**: Version `v1.1.0` has been released, incorporating this change along with others.

**Repository Issue Resolution**:

- **Recurring Task Handling**: Previously, when a recurring task was deleted from `recurring.yml` but still listed, it continued to appear in Mission Control, indicating an issue where the task was not fully removed from the database. This change is addressing that concern by ensuring the database entries are correctly handled, stopping the execution of deleted tasks and updating the Mission Control interface accordingly.

- **Specific Details Clarification**: Upon removal, the `Next` execution column should not change, and the task should not be scheduled for execution, as clarified during discussion and testing.
