The proposed Pull Request aims to ensure the DB connection pool is validated before initiating the supervisor, specifically addressing an issue where the DB connection pool size is too small. This serves as a follow-up to a previous PR (#427). Additionally, it is crucial to note a potential deployment issue when using Kamal and setting `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` as the pool size may cause the job runner process to fail, leading to an infinite restart loop unless the pool size is configured correctly.
