### Instructions for Programmer:

**Modify SolidQueue's Supervisor Behavior:**

1. **Skip Warning Log:**
   - Modify the Supervisor's log behavior to skip warnings about replacing missing forked processes when the Supervisor PID is 1.
   - This change is aimed at preventing false alerts when processes are reparented to PID 1, particularly relevant in Docker environments.

2. **Contextual Understanding:**
   - The issue arises when subprocesses, such as those generated by Puppeteer via `nodejs`, get reparented to PID 1.
   - Confirm that this behavior consistently occurs due to chained processes and results in the Supervisor logging unnecessary warnings.

3. **Test Condition:**
   - Ensure that the behavior is specifically conditional on the Supervisor having PID 1, which is common when running under Docker.

4. **Confirm and Validate:**
   - Test the modification to ensure that only relevant warnings are suppressed and that no legitimate process monitoring is ignored.
   - Verify the proposed solution prevents the warning logs in controlled test scenarios where the PID configuration matches the described situation.

5. **Link to Existing Discussion:**
   - Reference the complete PR discussion at [GitHub PR #450](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue/pull/450) to familiarize with the rationale and test scenarios mentioned by contributors.

Implement these changes carefully to ensure that the Supervisor log remains accurate and informative under all relevant conditions.
