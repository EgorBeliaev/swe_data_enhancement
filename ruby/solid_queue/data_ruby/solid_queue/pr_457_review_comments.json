For those running Kamal deployments and using the RAILS_MAX_THREADS as the pool size, the job runner process will fail to start but Kamal thinks it's a good deployment because the web process starts fine. The jobs docker container will be stuck in an infinite restart loop until the pool size is appropriately configured.\r\n"
