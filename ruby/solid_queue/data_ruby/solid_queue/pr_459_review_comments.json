        "body": "This PR updates SolidQueue::Pool from the deprecated Concurrent::Future to the more \"promising\" (sorry) Concurrent::Promises API.\r\n\r\nRational:\r\nThe Promises based API is documented as preferred over the Future API. Concurrent::Promises are more performant and deadlock resistant -- Good Things(tm) for SolidQueue.\r\n\r\nGiven Concurrent::Promises where released 2018, there is little \"new\" or \"not battle tested\" risk with this change."
