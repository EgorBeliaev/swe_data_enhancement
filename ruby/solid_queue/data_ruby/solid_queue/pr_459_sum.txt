**Instruction for Update:**

- Update `SolidQueue::Pool` from `Concurrent::Future` to `Concurrent::Promises` API.
- Ensure compatibility with existing system functionality as `Concurrent::Promises` is documented as the preferred API over `Concurrent::Future` and provides improved performance and resistance to deadlocks.
