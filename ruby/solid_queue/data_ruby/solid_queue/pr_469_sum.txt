**Instruction:**

Remove the long and verbose upgrade instructions from the `post_install_message`. The original detailed instructions were necessary to prevent issues when upgrading from versions earlier than 0.8, but they may no longer be necessary. Users tend to ignore release notes, changelogs, and upstream reviews before upgrading, but simplifying or removing these messages is now considered acceptable.
