Do you believe it should only be for workers now and add them for the others later?\r\n- Dispatchers currently trigger `run_stop_hooks` in [after_shutdown](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue/blob/cb5d230ddbf6732f2b78a5d3748475bab3b1deb5/lib/solid_queue/dispatcher.rb#L11)  but workers trigger them at [before_shutdown](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue/blob/cb5d230ddbf6732f2b78a5d3748475bab3b1deb5/lib/solid_queue/worker.rb#L8), I changed it in this PR but was that the expected behavior?"
