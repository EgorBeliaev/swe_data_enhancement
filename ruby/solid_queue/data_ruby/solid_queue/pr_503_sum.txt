**Instructions for Implementation:**

1. **Feature Addition:**
   - Introduce an `on_exit` hook to facilitate post-shutdown cleanup actions for all types of processes, focusing on workers.

2. **Behavior Adjustment:**
   - Ensure that both dispatchers and workers trigger `run_stop_hooks` consistently at the appropriate shutdown stage as per discussion; address the oversight change to maintain expected behavior. 

**Notes:**
- No restriction to workers only for the `on_exit` hook implementation is implied. The feature is applicable universally as per discussion approval.
