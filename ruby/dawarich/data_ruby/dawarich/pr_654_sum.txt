### Instructions for Implementation:

1. **Map Settings Update**: Enable the toggle for the "Fancy Routes" feature in the map settings located in the top left corner (represented by a screw nut icon). This feature colors routes based on segment speed.

2. **Polyline Hover Feature**: Implement functionality to display the speed of each segment when hovering over a polyline on the map.

3. **Custom Control Addition**: Add a custom control on the map to display the distance and number of points.

4. **Feature Renaming**: Change the name of the feature from "Polylines" to "Routes".
