Add support for additional import file formats: owntracks (.rec), google semantic history (e.g., 2013_JULY.json), google phone takeout (e.g., location-history.json), and google's Records.json in the `watcher.rb` file. Ensure that these formats are correctly distinguished from geojson files, despite sharing the .json extension. Update the `imports_controller` to include missing lines for processing these import formats. Implement tests in `spec/services/imports/watcher_spec.rb` to verify point creation from imported files and establish realistic file structures for each type for testing purposes. Address final fixes as needed.
