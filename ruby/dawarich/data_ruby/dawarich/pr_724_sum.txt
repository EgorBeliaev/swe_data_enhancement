   - Enable the PostGIS extension for PostgreSQL to support geospatial queries.

2. **Trip Paths Management:**
   - Modify the database schema to store trip paths independently of individual points.
   - Update trip rendering logic to use pre-calculated paths for map visualization instead of direct coordinate lists.

3. **Photo Request Optimization:**
