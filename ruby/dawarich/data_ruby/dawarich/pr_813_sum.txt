### Instructions for Programmer:

1. **Speed Units Update:**
   - Ensure that all speed data in the system is converted to meters per second. This is crucial as Dawarich expects speeds in this unit.
   - For GPSLogger users, update the configuration from `"vel": "%SPD_KMH"` to `"vel": "%SPD"`.
   - Implement an automatic conversion for OwnTracks users' speeds in kilometers per hour to meters per second. This conversion happens server-side, so no changes are needed from users' end.

2. **Conversion Script for Existing Data:**
   - Access the Dawarich console.
   - Retrieve all non-imported points with velocity using:
     ```ruby
     points = Point.where(import_id: nil).where("velocity != ? OR velocity != ?", nil, "0")
     ```
   - Convert the speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second and round to one decimal place:
     ```ruby
     points.update_all("velocity = CAST(ROUND(CAST((CAST(velocity AS FLOAT) * 1000 / 3600) AS NUMERIC), 1) AS TEXT)")
     ```

3. **Selective Conversion Based on Date Range:**
   - If applicable, for points with known speed units during specific time frames, use:
     ```ruby
     points = Point.where(import_id: nil).where("velocity != ? OR velocity != ?", nil, "0").where("timestamp BETWEEN ? AND ?", "2025-01-01", "2025-01-31")
     ```
   - Apply the conversion script from step 2.

4. **POST Endpoint Update:**
   - Modify the `POST /api/v1/owntracks/points` endpoint to convert speeds to meters per second when the `topic` parameter is included in the request.

5. **Bug Fixes:**
   - Allow deletion of multiple points from the map after one point is deleted. (Fixes issue #723 and #678)
   - Ensure that exported files are removed from the server upon deletion. (Fixes issue #808)
   - Implement a popup for naming and saving an area after it's drawn on the map. (Fixes issue #740)

6. **Additional Headers:**
   - Add the `X-Dawarich-Version` header to the response of the `GET /api/v1/health` endpoint. (Enhancement #800)
