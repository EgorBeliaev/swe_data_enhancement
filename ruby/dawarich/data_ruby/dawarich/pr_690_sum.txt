**Instructions:**

1. **Add Functionality:**
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for map points. Ensure the "Points" layer is enabled to see and adjust point positions.

2. **Configuration Changes:**
   - Modify the environment settings to run seeds in production to allow Unraid users to have a default user setup.
   - Precompile assets in production using a dummy secret key base for environment consistency.

3. **Bug Fix:**
   - Correct the issue where map routes are not highlighted properly when hovered or clicked.

These changes need to be integrated consistently with the existing codebase. Ensure all updates are tested, particularly the drag-and-drop functionality and highlighting fix, for seamless user experience.
