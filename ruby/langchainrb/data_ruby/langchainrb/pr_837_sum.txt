### Instruction for Programmer:

Ensure that for function schemas within the Anthropic tool integration, a default empty `input_schema` is automatically added when no parameters are specified. This adjustment is necessary to meet Anthropic's requirements and to prevent the errors being encountered when using tools without parameters, as reflected in the closed issue #826 and its associated "400 Bad Request" errors.
