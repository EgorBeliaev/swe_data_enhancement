The pull request applies a workaround to a query issue in the Chroma library, addressing an `InvalidArgumentError` that occurs when the API expects exactly one operator but receives an empty set, resulting in a 400 client error. To resolve this problem, wait for an update since a test has initially failed, and note that there is a new release of the Chroma gem that addresses the API change.
