**Issue Description:**

The repository is facing a problem with the "anthropic" gem. During usage, an error occurs due to an implicit conversion of `nil` into a `String`. This happens in the `http.rb` file at line 102, within the `concat` method call on `response["content"][0]["text"]`. The error suggests that `response["content"][0]["text"]` may be `nil` at the point of concatenation with `delta`.

**Proposed Fix:**

An open pull request in the anthopic gem at https://github.com/alexrudall/anthropic/pull/25 has been identified to address this issue, and the fix has been released in version v0.3.1.

**Instructions:**

1. **Update Dependency**: Upgrade the "anthropic" gem to v0.3.1 to incorporate the fix.
2. **Testing**: After updating, test the functionality involving the `anthropic.chat` method to ensure that the error regarding the nil conversion is resolved.
