**Instruction for Changes**:

- Update the `MistralAIMessage` class to properly handle outputs categorized as "Tool" by breaking up the hash based on specific roles, aligning it with the API conventions outlined in the [Mistral API documentation](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/#tag/chat/operation/chat_completion_v1_chat_completions_post).
- Ensure the proper handling and processing for each role as seen in the referenced API convention.

**Issue Fixed**:

This PR addresses issue [#839](https://github.com/patterns-ai-core/langchainrb/issues/839) in the `patterns-ai-core/langchainrb` repository. The problem was related to improper handling of "Tool" outputs by `MistralAIMessage`, which required restructuring to comply with the API's role-based hash conventions.
