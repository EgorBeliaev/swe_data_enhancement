This pull request introduces a standardized handling of tool responses in the Langchain library by implementing the `ToolResponse` class and `ToolHelpers` module. Tools are updated to include `ToolHelpers`, returning `ToolResponse` objects, and handling various cases consistently. The `Assistant` now supports both `ToolResponse` and legacy formats, with comprehensive testing added. No breaking changes occur, maintaining compatibility. Migration involves including `ToolHelpers` and using `tool_response` for custom tools. Future plans involve moving response formatting to LLM adapters.

Instruction for repository modification:
1. Implement `ToolResponse` class to encapsulate content and image URLs.
2. Incorporate `ToolHelpers` module across all tools to simplify tool response creation.
3. Update tools to return `ToolResponse` objects.
4. Modify `Assistant` class to handle both `ToolResponse` objects and legacy responses.
5. Enhance test coverage to include new response formats.
6. Maintain backward compatibility by supporting legacy raw value returns.
7. Plan for future improvements by shifting response formatting to LLM adapters.

Note: It's discussed to possibly support base64 encoded image representation in the future.
