### Instruction for Programmer:

Implement a handler to manage and properly respond to bad responses received from the `RestClient` within the repository. Ensure the following:

1. **Testing:** 
   - Run the complete test suite to confirm that all tests and linters pass.
   - Add additional tests specific to this new handler to verify its functionality.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Update any necessary documentation to clearly describe the changes made and the reasoning behind those changes.

3. **Code Quality:**
   - Write clear and descriptive commit messages detailing the changes.
   - Ensure the code is well-documented, understandable, and follows repository guidelines.

4. **Objective Achievement:**
   - Confirm this handler effectively addresses the issue of unhandled bad responses by demonstrating through tests or reproducing scenarios.

### Issue Being Fixed:

The PR addresses the issue of unhandled bad responses in the repository by adding a specialized handler for such scenarios from the `RestClient`. This aims to improve system robustness and user feedback by properly managing unexpected or error responses.
