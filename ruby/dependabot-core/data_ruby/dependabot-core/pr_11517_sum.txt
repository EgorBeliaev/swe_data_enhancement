**Instruction for Changes:**

- Implement functionality to handle specific Sentry errors related to Go module dependencies in this repository:
  1. Errors stemming from the absence of a `go.sum` entry, prompting the instruction to execute `go mod download` for the specified modules.
  2. Errors indicating a particular Go module does not contain a required package.
  
- Thoroughly test the implemented code to ensure it resolves the identified issues effectively.
- Ensure all existing tests pass upon integrating these changes.
- Document the modifications made in the codebase clearly, referencing the specific problems it addresses and the approach taken for resolution.
- Confirm and document that the new code is functionally equivalent to the replaced code in terms of capability and integration.
