**Instructions for Update:**

1. **Add Error Handlers:**
   - Implement error handlers specifically for composer-related errors:
     - Handle _private source authentication failures_.
     - Address _invalid requirements_ in manifest files.
     - Manage _bad response_ errors.

2. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Ensure complete test suite is run successfully, validating that all tests and linters pass.
   - Conduct thorough testing of code changes to confirm expected functionality, including new tests for any additional features.

3. **Documentation and Clarity:**
   - Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
   - Provide a detailed description of changes, explaining the problem, how it was fixed, and relevant implementation details.
   - Ensure code is well-documented for clarity and ease of understanding.
