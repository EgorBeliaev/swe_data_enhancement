**Instructions for Implementing the Fix:**

1. **Issue to Address:** The current system fails to detect NPM versions when they are empty or set to 0, causing unsupported errors in Dependabot. This PR ensures these edge cases are managed without causing disruptions.

2. **NPM Version Defaulting Logic:**
   - If there is no lockfile or itâ€™s empty, default to **npm 10**.
   - If `lockfileVersion >= 3`, use **npm 10**.
   - If `lockfileVersion == 2` or `lockfileVersion == 1`, use **npm 8**.
   - If the lockfile is unparseable, also fallback to **npm 8**.
   - When running npm operations (e.g., `install`), always use **NPM_VERSION=9.6.5** explicitly.

3. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Ensure automated tests pass and validate the fix manually.
   - Check for successful detection and handling of previously unsupported NPM versions.

4. **Confirmation and Deployment:**
   - Once implemented, verify that the fix is operational in relevant repositories. Rerun necessary processes to ensure the changes take effect. Users like @bcomnes have confirmed the solution restores expected functionality.
