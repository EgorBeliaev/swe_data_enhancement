### Condensed Instruction:

Enhance version detection to specifically support the `latest` constraint, ensuring it resolves to the newest available version. Introduce `LATEST_REGEX` for proper differentiation of `latest` from other constraints. Confirm alignment with expected package manager behavior through testing, highlighting that no regressions occur with wildcard (`*`) or other constraints.
