        "body": "### What are you trying to accomplish?  \r\nThis PR introduces a constraints check to ensure that if no valid constraints exist, the function returns no requirement. This prevents incorrect requirement values from being returned when constraints are missing or invalid.  \r\n\r\n### Anything you want to highlight for special attention from reviewers?  \r\nThe key change here is the addition of a validation step to check for constraints before returning a requirement. If no valid constraints are found, it now correctly returns no requirement.  \r\n\r\n### How will you know you've accomplished your goal?  \r\n- The issue where requirements were incorrectly determined in the absence of constraints should no longer occur.  \r\n- The tests have been updated to verify that no requirement is returned when constraints are missing or invalid.  \r\n- Running the complete test suite ensures that existing functionality remains unaffected while this fix is correctly applied.  \r\n\r\n### Checklist  \r\n- [x] I have run the complete test suite to ensure all tests and linters pass.  \r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my code changes to ensure they work as expected, including adding additional tests for new functionality.  \r\n- [x] I have written clear and descriptive commit messages.  \r\n- [x] I have provided a detailed description of the changes in the pull request, including the problem it addresses, how it fixes the problem, and any relevant details about the implementation.  \r\n- [x] I have ensured that the code is well-documented and easy to understand.
