This is used in Ruby on Rails to lazy load required files based on class and file naming conventions. A small number of shared files do not match the conventions and need to be ignored in zeitwerk and manually required as needed until the files themselves can be reorganised.\r\n\r\nThe FileFetcher is currently guarded with `allow_beta_ecosystems? && Experiments.enabled?(:enable_bun_ecosystem)` to control rollout and usage.\r\n\r\n### How will you know you've accomplished your goal?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  * If you've reproduced an error, can you link to, or demonstrate the reproduction?\r\n  * If you've added a new feature, how will you demonstrate it to others?\r\n  * If you've refactored code, how will you demonstrate that the new code is functionally equivalent to the old code?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rspec spec/dependabot/bun/` specs should pass.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Before requesting review, please ensure that your pull request fulfills the following requirements: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run the complete test suite to ensure all tests and linters pass.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my code changes to ensure they work as expected, including adding additional tests for new functionality.\r\n- [x] I have written clear and descriptive commit messages.\r\n- [x] I have provided a detailed description of the changes in the pull request, including the problem it addresses, how it fixes the problem, and any relevant details about the implementation.\r\n- [x] I have ensured that the code is well-documented and easy to understand.\r\n\r\n### Deleted PR\r\n\r\nA failed rebase caused the previous [PR](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/pull/11442) to close.\r\n"
