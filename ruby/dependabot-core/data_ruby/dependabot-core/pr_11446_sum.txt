**Instruction for Implementing Changes:**

1. **Add Bun Ecosystem Support:**
   - Introduce the basic files and implement the `FileFetcher` for the Bun ecosystem.
   - Ensure this new functionality is controlled by feature flags: `allow_beta_ecosystems?` and `Experiments.enabled?(:enable_bun_ecosystem)`.

2. **Integrate Zeitwerk Gem for Autoloading:**
   - Utilize the `zeitwerk` gem specifically for autoloading in the Bun ecosystem.
   - Identify shared files that donâ€™t conform to `zeitwerk` conventions and set them to be ignored. Manually require these until they can be reorganized to meet naming conventions.

3. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Confirm successful implementation by running `rspec spec/dependabot/bun/` tests and ensure all Specs pass.

4. **Documentation and Compliance:**
   - Ensure all code is well-documented to facilitate understanding.
   - Provide clear and descriptive commit messages detailing the problem and its resolution.

5. **Rebase Strategy:**
   - Note that a failed rebase caused the previous PR #11442 to close, ensure correct rebasing practices to avoid closure.
   
6. **Follow-ups and Contributions:**
   - This change is a follow-up to PR #11441 and contributes to resolving issues #8148 and #6528. Keep track of these connections for clarity in project timeline and dependent tasks.
