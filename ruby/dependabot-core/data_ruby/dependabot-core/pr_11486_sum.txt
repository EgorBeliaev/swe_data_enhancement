**Instructions for Updating the Repository:**

1. **Objective**: Implement an error handling mechanism to raise a registry error when the remote server does not provide the requested resource.

2. **Approach**:
   - Extract and handle errors from the npm response message, specifically targeting scenarios where there is no status from the npm response.

3. **Verification**:
   - Run the CLI against the referenced repository (`https://github.com/dsp-testing/security-update-error`) to ensure the following log output confirms the error handling:
     ```
     2025/02/05 00:28:13 INFO Handled error whilst updating serve-static: registry_error {:status=>404, :msg=>"The remote server failed to provide the requested resource"}
     ```

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that the `serve-static` dependency is handled correctly with the error `registry_error` as highlighted in the log verification step.

5. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Conduct a complete test suite to ensure all tests and linters pass.
   - Critically test code changes and introduce any necessary tests for new functionality.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Ensure that all code is well-documented.
   - Write clear and descriptive commit messages and provide a detailed description of any changes made, including the addressed problem and the implementation details.

By effectively following these instructions, you should be able to implement and verify the necessary changes to handle registry errors appropriately.
