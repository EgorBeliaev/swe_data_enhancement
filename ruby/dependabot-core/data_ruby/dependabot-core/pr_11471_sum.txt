**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Fix Bug in Lockfile Update:**
   - Ensure PNPM workspace catalogs are retained in lockfiles during dependency updates.
   - Reference `pnpm-workspace.yaml` when updating lockfiles to maintain catalog entries.

2. **Code Simplification:**
   - Simplify the process of passing workspace content to the lockfile updater.
   - Remove the `is_catalog` flag as it is no longer necessary.
   - Directly pass `@updated_pnpm_workspace_content` to ensure catalog entries are preserved.

3. **Verification:**
   - Run the complete test suite to confirm all tests and linters pass.
   - Confirm that PNPM lockfiles successfully update catalog entries post-update.
