**Instruction for Programmer:**

Update the process for managing PNPM workspace catalogs by replacing the use of `pnpm update` with `pnpm install` to correctly update the lockfile. This change is necessary to ensure proper handling of workspace dependencies during catalog-wide updates, while maintaining the current behavior for standard package updates. Be sure that the lockfiles are accurately generated in both workspace and regular project scenarios.
