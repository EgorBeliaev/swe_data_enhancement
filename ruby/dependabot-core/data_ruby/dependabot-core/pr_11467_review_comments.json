This will replace the current runtime error that is polluting Sentry. I'll be adding this error on the API repo as well.\r\n\r\n### How will you know you've accomplished your goal?\r\nThis error won't appear in Sentry anymore.\r\n<!--\r\n  * If you've reproduced an error, can you link to, or demonstrate the reproduction?\r\n  * If you've added a new feature, how will you demonstrate it to others?\r\n  * If you've refactored code, how will you demonstrate that the new code is functionally equivalent to the old code?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Before requesting review, please ensure that your pull request fulfills the following requirements: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run the complete test suite to ensure all tests and linters pass.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my code changes to ensure they work as expected, including adding additional tests for new functionality.\r\n- [x] I have written clear and descriptive commit messages.\r\n- [x] I have provided a detailed description of the changes in the pull request, including the problem it addresses, how it fixes the problem, and any relevant details about the implementation.\r\n- [x] I have ensured that the code is well-documented and easy to understand.\r\n"
