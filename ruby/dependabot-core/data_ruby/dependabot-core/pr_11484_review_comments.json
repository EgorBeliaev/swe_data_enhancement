        "body": "### **What are you trying to accomplish?**  \r\nThe `fetch_files` phase was failing due to a Corepack installation issue with `pnpm`. The error stemmed from an inability to verify the package manager's signature when installing `pnpm@9.15.5`. This caused the entire process to fail.  \r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue by activating the local package manager as a fallback when Corepack installation fails. This ensures that Dependabot can proceed with file fetching even if Corepack encounters verification issues.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Anything you want to highlight for special attention from reviewers?**  \r\n- The fallback mechanism was chosen to prevent hard failures during `pnpm` installation and instead allow Dependabot to use an already available version.  \r\n- If there are concerns about security implications, we can discuss alternative solutions, such as stricter validation checks before activating the fallback.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **How will you know you've accomplished your goal?**  \r\n- Dependabot no longer fails during the `fetch_files` phase due to `pnpm` installation issues.  \r\n- Running `bin/run fetch_files` now completes successfully without encountering `file_fetcher_error`.  \r\n- Local testing confirms that the fallback mechanism works correctly when Corepack installation fails.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Checklist**  \r\n- [x] I have run the complete test suite to ensure all tests and linters pass.  \r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my code changes to ensure they work as expected, including adding additional tests for new functionality.  \r\n- [x] I have written clear and descriptive commit messages.  \r\n- [x] I have provided a detailed description of the changes in the pull request, including the problem it addresses, how it fixes the problem, and any relevant details about the implementation.  \r\n- [x] I have ensured that the code is well-documented and easy to understand.
