        "body": "### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\n\r\nWhen updating PNPM workspace catalogs, we need to use pnpm install to update the lockfile instead of pnpm update. This ensures proper handling of workspace dependencies when making catalog-wide updates.\r\n\r\n### Anything you want to highlight for special attention from reviewers?\r\n\r\nThis approach ensures that workspace updates use the correct PNPM command while maintaining existing behavior for regular package updates.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there were multiple ways to approach the problem, why did you pick this one? -->\r\n\r\n### How will you know you've accomplished your goal?\r\n\r\n1. Running pnpm update in a workspace project - should correctly update the lockfile using install\r\n2. Running pnpm update in a regular project - should use the normal update+install flow\r\n3. Checking that lockfiles are generated correctly in both scenarios\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  * If you've reproduced an error, can you link to, or demonstrate the reproduction?\r\n  * If you've added a new feature, how will you demonstrate it to others?\r\n  * If you've refactored code, how will you demonstrate that the new code is functionally equivalent to the old code?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- Before requesting review, please ensure that your pull request fulfills the following requirements: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run the complete test suite to ensure all tests and linters pass.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my code changes to ensure they work as expected, including adding additional tests for new functionality.\r\n- [x] I have written clear and descriptive commit messages.\r\n- [x] I have provided a detailed description of the changes in the pull request, including the problem it addresses, how it fixes the problem, and any relevant details about the implementation.\r\n- [x] I have ensured that the code is well-documented and easy to understand.\r\n"
