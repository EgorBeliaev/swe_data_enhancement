        "body": "This PR improves version constraint handling by adding explicit support for `latest`. While we previously handled the wildcard (`*`), `latest` was not recognized separately. This update ensures `latest` correctly resolves to the newest available version.\r\n\r\n#### **What issues does this affect or fix?**  \r\n- Adds explicit handling for the `latest` constraint.  \r\n- Ensures `latest` resolves to the newest available version.  \r\n- Improves consistency in version resolution logic.\r\n\r\n#### **Anything you want to highlight for special attention from reviewers?**  \r\n- This change introduces `LATEST_REGEX` to distinguish `latest` from other constraints.  \r\n- Please verify that the behavior aligns with expected package manager resolution.\r\n\r\n#### **How will you know you've accomplished your goal?**  \r\n- Tests confirm `latest` resolves correctly to the newest available version.  \r\n- No regressions in existing wildcard (`*`) or constraint handling.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Checklist**\r\n- [x] I have run the complete test suite to ensure all tests and linters pass.  \r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my code changes, including adding tests for new functionality.  \r\n- [x] I have written clear and descriptive commit messages.  \r\n- [x] I have provided a detailed description of the changes in the pull request.  \r\n- [x] I have ensured that the code is well-documented and easy to understand.
