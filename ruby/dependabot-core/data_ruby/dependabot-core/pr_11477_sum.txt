**Instruction for Repository Update:**

Remove the feature flag `:enable_pnpm_workspace_catalog` to allow all users to update PNPM catalogs. This change involves eliminating any conditional logic based on this flag throughout the codebase, ensuring that PNPM catalog updates are universally accessible without restriction. Make sure all related tests pass and update documentation to reflect the absence of the feature flag.
