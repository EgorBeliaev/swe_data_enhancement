**Instruction for Programmer:**

Update `poetry_file_updater.rb` to handle the specific error "Content did not change!" by introducing a new error type `DependencyFileContentNotChanged` in `errors.rb` to replace the current `RuntimeError`. This alteration aims to prevent this error message from appearing in Sentry. Ensure these changes are reflected in the corresponding API repository as well. Make sure all tests (including new tests for this functionality) pass and document the changes clearly.
