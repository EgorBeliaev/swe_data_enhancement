**Instruction for Repository Maintainer:**

1. **Detect Misconfigurations:**
   - Implement logic to check for `MisconfiguredTooling` error when:
     - Both `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` exist in a parent directory.
     - The update process is attempted from a workspace subdirectory instead of the root.

2. **Valid Configuration Handling:**
   - Ensure no error is triggered if the workspace configuration is valid, i.e., the entire workspace resides in a subdirectory (e.g., `/some-project`).

3. **Update Dependabot Configuration:**
   - Update `dependabot.yml` to configure updates only at the root directory (`/`) for PNPM workspaces.
   - Remove configurations that specify updates from subdirectories (e.g., `/client`, `/server`).

4. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Add test cases to confirm that subdirectory updates trigger `MisconfiguredTooling`.
   - Manually validate that valid workspace configurations operate correctly without errors.

5. **Documentation and Communication:**
   - Ensure that any changes include clear and descriptive commit messages and documentation explaining the problem and solution.

**Repository Issue Being Fixed:**

The primary issue being resolved is the incorrect behavior of Dependabot in PNPM workspaces, where updates from subdirectories instead of the root cause errors. The PR introduces a check to raise errors for misconfigured updates and ensures updates only occur correctly from the root directory.
