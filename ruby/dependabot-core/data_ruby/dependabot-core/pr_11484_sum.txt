**Instruction to Programmer:**

Activate local package manager fallback in the event of Corepack installation failure to resolve pnpm signature verification issues during the `fetch_files` phase. Ensure Dependabot can continue operating by using an available package manager version if Corepack fails. Confirm successful execution of `bin/run fetch_files` without resulting in `file_fetcher_error`. Perform comprehensive testing to validate that fallback mechanism works as intended and pass all tests and linters. Document the changes clearly and update commit messages accordingly.
