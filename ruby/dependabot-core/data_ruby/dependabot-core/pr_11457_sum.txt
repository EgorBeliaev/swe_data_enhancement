**Instruction for Programmer:**

Implement a constraints validation step in the function to ensure that if no valid constraints are present, it returns "no requirement." This update should prevent incorrect requirement values from being returned when constraints are absent or invalid. Ensure updated tests verify this behavior and run the entire test suite to confirm no existing functionality is impacted. Document your code and updates clearly.
