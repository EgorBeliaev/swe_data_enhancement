**Issue Description:**  
The PR addresses a Sentry error in the `GemspecDependencyNameFinder` class. The error is caused by a type mismatch where an `Integer` value (`2`) is being passed to a method expecting a type `T.nilable(T.any(Parser::AST::Node, String, Symbol))`.

**Instructions to Programmer:**

1. **Identify the Error Source:**
   - Locate the error in `bundler/lib/dependabot/bundler/file_updater/gemspec_dependency_name_finder.rb` at line 46 in the `find_dependency_name_node` method.
   
2. **Fix the Type Mismatch:**
   - Ensure that the parameter 'node' being passed is of type `T.nilable(T.any(Parser::AST::Node, String, Symbol))` rather than an `Integer`.

3. **Verify the Fix:**
   - Confirm that after making changes, no Sentry errors appear related to the `GemspecDependencyNameFinder` class.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Run the complete test suite to ensure all tests and linters pass.
   - Add additional tests if necessary to verify the fix.
   - Ensure that the code is well-documented, and clearly describe the changes in the commit messages.

These steps should resolve the type mismatch error and prevent future occurrences.
