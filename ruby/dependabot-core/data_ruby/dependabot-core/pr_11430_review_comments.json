        "body": "### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\n\r\nThis change addresses the issue where the NPM version detection failed when the version is empty or set to 0. The fix ensures that the error is handled gracefully, allowing Dependabot to properly detect and work with NPM versions that were previously unsupported.\r\n\r\n### Anything you want to highlight for special attention from reviewers?\r\n\r\nThe fix specifically targets the issue where an unsupported error occurred due to the version being empty or 0. It ensures that these edge cases are handled without causing a disruption in the update process.\r\n\r\n### How will you know you've accomplished your goal?\r\n\r\n- The issue of failing to detect NPM versions that are empty or 0 should be resolved.\r\n- The system should now handle these cases without raising errors or affecting other functionality.\r\n- Automated tests should pass successfully, and manual validation should show that the detection now works correctly for edge cases.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run the complete test suite to ensure all tests and linters pass.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my code changes to ensure they work as expected, including adding additional tests for new functionality.\r\n- [x] I have written clear and descriptive commit messages.\r\n- [x] I have provided a detailed description of the changes in the pull request, including the problem it addresses, how it fixes the problem, and any relevant details about the implementation.\r\n- [x] I have ensured that the code is well-documented and easy to understand.\r\n"

However, when running npm for operations such as `install`, we **do not** use the detected version. Instead, we explicitly run npm with **NPM_VERSION=9.6.5**.  \r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any further clarification!  "
