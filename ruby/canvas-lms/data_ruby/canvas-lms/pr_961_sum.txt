**Instruction for Programmer:**

Implement a validation check for VeriCite assignments to ensure that only "Text Entry" and "File Uploads" submission types are allowed when VeriCite is enabled. Modify the assignment creation and editing functions so that if any other submission type is selected alongside VeriCite, a warning should be displayed, and the assignment should not be saved. Verify that without VeriCite enabled, any submission type combinations can be saved. Ensure this validation is applied regardless of the VeriCite plugin's enabled state.
