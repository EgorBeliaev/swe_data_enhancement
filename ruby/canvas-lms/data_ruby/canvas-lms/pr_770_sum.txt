**Instructions for Repository Update:**

1. **Files to Update:**
   - Locate the two files that have syntax errors when CoffeeScript is upgraded from version 1.6.2 to any version >= 1.7.0.

2. **Syntax Fixes Needed:**
   - Resolve the `unexpected .` syntax error.
   - Fix the `cannot use own with for-in` issue.

3. **Testing Plan:**
   - Ensure that changes do not affect existing functionality. Confirm whether this code is covered by test cases, though it may not currently be.

4. **Context:**
   - These changes are necessary to allow compatibility with CoffeeScript versions up to 1.10, necessitated by a dependency on a gem that requires a higher version of CoffeeScript.

**Note:** This is classified as a low-priority task.
