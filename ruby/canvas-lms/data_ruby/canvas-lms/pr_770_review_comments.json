        "body": "CoffeeScript source is currently pinned to 1.6.2 but these two files will have syntax errors if/when coffeescript is upgraded to >=1.7.0\n\nThe syntax errors are `unexpected .` and `cannot use own with for-in`.\n\nTo demonstrate the syntax errors, temporarily modify `Gemfile.d/development_and_test.rb` to use `1.7.0` for `coffee-script-source`, bundle update, and recompile assets.\n\nThese are the only 2 errors and will work with coffeescript 1.10 as well.\n\nTest Plan\n- There should be no change. I did not see if this code is currently covered by a test case.\n\nThis is a low-priority PR. I needed to track down these two problems to use a gem which required a higher version of coffee-script.\n"
