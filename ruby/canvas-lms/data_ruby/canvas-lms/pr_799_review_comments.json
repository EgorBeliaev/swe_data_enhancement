It does not upgrade to 3.x or 4.x which could introduce more changes.\n"

One more thing, if you wouldn't mind squashing the two commits to one, that would help to keep the git history a bit cleaner.  I would love to just use the squash and merge feature of GitHub, but we don't merge directly from GitHub, it first goes through our internal Gerrit repository and gets replicated.\n"
