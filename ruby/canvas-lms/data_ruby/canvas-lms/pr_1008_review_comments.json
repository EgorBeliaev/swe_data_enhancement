        "body": "This pull request enhances the Developer Keys page in two ways:\r\n\r\n## Notes field\r\n\r\nA notes field is added on the `developer_keys` table. When creating a key, there is sometimes a need to record more information (for example, a ticket number for the request, information on how the key is to be used, etc). The notes field is exposed in the developer key listing, in the API response, and in the dialog for creating/editing a key.\r\n\r\n## Usage stats\r\n\r\nWhile adding the notes field, I found a `TODO` marker for \"add some better stats here, like token count, last usage, etc.\". Mark that `TODO` as `DONE`! This PR adds two methods to the `DeveloperKey` model: `access_token_count` and `last_used_at`. These fields are returned in the API response, and are displayed in the Stats column on the Developer Key page.\r\n\r\n---\r\n![screenshot 2017-03-21 16 55 19](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/146111/24176111/5650248c-0e57-11e7-9114-bfd4887d6fe0.png)\r\n\r\n![screenshot 2017-03-21 16 55 28](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/146111/24176125/63ad6ba8-0e57-11e7-8e4d-070a4778ff0e.png)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI have left my commits un-squashed in case there are changes required. I can squash them into one commit prior to merging.\r\n\r\nA signed CLA is on file under my employer, Simon Fraser University.\r\n"
