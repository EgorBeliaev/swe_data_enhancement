        "body": "Yard is having trouble with multi-line statements that use dot-first notation and have comments at the end of line.\nThe commit moves to end-of-line dot notation (which is more standard in the codebase) and removes some obvious comments. Either change would resolve the issue.\n\nThis also switches one `@param` tag to `@argument` since it is not a param.\n\nTest Plan:\n- Run `rake doc:api`\n- The Yard docs should be built without errors/warnings\n"
