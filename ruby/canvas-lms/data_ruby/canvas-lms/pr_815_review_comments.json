Once enabled, an option will show up in the assignment settings for \"inline\" or \"upload\" assignment types. This plugin uses all of the existing turnitin data structures in the tables as requested. The only additional DDL required is a flag on the assignments table in order to differentiate which service is enabled:\n\nalter table assignments ADD vericite_enabled boolean;\n\nHere is a video of the plugin in action:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ttdFkyR1VTM?t=36s (note that it now uses the plugin configuration instead of the account settings shown in the video)\n"

Would nessessitate a change to Gemfile.d/app.rb.  Also note: As a dependency, we didn't code review the gem.)\n-  style conventions in new code should follow the ruby conventions.  For example, camel case variables in submission.check_verivite_status should be fixed.  (Not the only area, just one example.)\n\nFYI, spec files weren't code reviewed deeply because the amount of implementation changes suggested would nessessitate changes to the specs.\n"

It was the provider flag not being set in all cases, so make sure they test with a fresh database.\n"
