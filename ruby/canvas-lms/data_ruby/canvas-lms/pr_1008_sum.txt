Add a "notes" field to the `developer_keys` table to record additional information during key creation. Implement two methods in the `DeveloperKey` model: `access_token_count` and `last_used_at`, exposing these in the API and displaying them in the Stats column on the Developer Key page. Add an index to `access_tokens` on `developer_key_id` and `last_used_at` using the following migration:

```ruby
class AddLastUsedAtIndexToDeveloperKeys < ActiveRecord::Migration[4.2]
  def change
    add_index :access_tokens, [:developer_key_id, :last_used_at], algorithm: :concurrently
  end
end
```

Ensure the index operation is marked as `predeploy`. Once changes are complete, squash all commits into one for the final merge.
