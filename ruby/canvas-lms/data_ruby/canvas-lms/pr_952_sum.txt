**Instructions for Fixing Rubric API Pagination:**

1. **Fix Pagination Headers**: Correct the rubric API endpoints to ensure they return the correct URLs in pagination headers. This should specifically resolve the issue where assignment URLs were being returned incorrectly.

2. **Enhance Test Coverage**: Add tests for rubric API in account contexts in addition to existing course context tests, similar to how tests are structured in the `external_tools_controller`.

3. **Address Typos**: Review and correct typos present in the test files.

4. **Ensure Code Integration**: Rebase your changes on the current master branch and squash commits into a single commit for easier integration.

5. **Verification**: Once integrated, ensure the test suite runs successfully ("green") to confirm stability and correctness of changes.
