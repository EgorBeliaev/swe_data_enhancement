**Issue Description:**  
The pull request aims to fix a warning when redefining YAML in the repository. This warning appears as "warning: already initialized constant YAML" during the execution of `rails c` in the console.

**Instruction:**  
Restore the original version of the commit to ensure compatibility with Ruby 2.1. The newer commit version removed code that is necessary for this Ruby version, causing a `NameError` related to `SafeYAML::PsychResolver`. Ensure that the console loads without warnings and that all tests pass after the restoration.
