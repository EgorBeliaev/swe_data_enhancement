1. **Functionality Update:**
   - Permit `data-*` attributes in HTML content to pass the sanitization process.

2. **Commit Management:**
   - Ensure all changes related to this update are squashed into a single commit for cleaner git history.

**Test Plan:**
- Edit a wiki page using the HTML editor to include custom HTML5 code with `data-*` attributes.
