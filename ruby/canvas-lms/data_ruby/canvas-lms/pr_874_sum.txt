**Instructions for Programmer:**

1. Update the CSS to prevent truncation of Question Bank titles using `text-overflow`. This will ensure that longer titles are displayed in full where possible.
2. Test Plan:
   - Create a course and add Question Banks with titles longer than 30 characters, such as:
     - "Final Assessment Question Bank 1"
     - "Final Assessment Question Bank 2"
     - "Assessment Bank with Really, Really, ... long name" (over 80 characters)
   - Ensure that when adding a new question group in a quiz and linking to a Question Bank, the list displays titles without truncation.
   - Verify that extremely long names do not wrap.
