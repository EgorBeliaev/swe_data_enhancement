### Instruction to Programmer:

1. **Enable VeriCite Reports in Peer Review:**
   - Implement functionality to allow reviewers to see VeriCite reports when an assignment is both VeriCite and Peer Review enabled.

2. **Test Plan Integration:**
   - Ensure to test the following scenarios:
     1. Enable VeriCite in the account plugins page.
     2. Create an assignment with both VeriCite and Peer Review enabled.
     3. Submit assignments as multiple students.
     4. Assign peer reviews manually or automatically.
     5. Verify as a student that a peer review includes the VeriCite report.
     6. Modify assignment VeriCite settings to "Students Can See the Originality Report" set to "none."
     7. Verify that students cannot see VeriCite reports on the Peer Review page.

3. **Testing Enhancements:**
   - Add a unit test covering the mentioned scenarios to ensure consistent behavior.
   - Address QA feedback: Students were not seeing VeriCite icons in peer review after submission.
   - Ensure a sufficient data set for peer review testing to avoid similar QA issues.

4. **Code Improvements:**
   - Adjust the logic in `user_can_peer_review_plagiarism` to align with the updated requirements.
   - Integrate a Selenium unit test to cover end-to-end scenarios.

### Issue Being Fixed:

The PR addresses enabling visibility of VeriCite reports within Peer Review assessments. It corrects a previous oversight where insufficient test datasets led to the misdiagnosis that students were not seeing VeriCite-related information in peer review submissions.
