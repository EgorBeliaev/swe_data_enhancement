Using CSS text-overflow will better handle long titles.\n\nTest Plan:\n- Create a course and create question banks with long names (>30 characters)\n  - \"Final Assessment Question Bank 1\"\n  - \"Final Assessment Question Bank 2\"\n  - \"Assessment Bank with Really, Really, ... long name\" (>80 characters)\n- Create a quiz and add a new question group\n- Click \"Link to a Question Bank\"\n- The list of available question banks will no longer be truncated\n- The extremely long name should not wrap\n\nI know Quizzes is in the process of being overhauled but I assume Question Banks will be around for a little while during the transition. I have a few more PRs coming. CLA on file.\n"
