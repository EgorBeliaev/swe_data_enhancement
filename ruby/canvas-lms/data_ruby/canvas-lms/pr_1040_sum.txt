**Instruction to Programmer:**

Update the OAuth2 provider's checkbox label for remembering authorization. Ensure that instead of displaying a hash with the English value and CSS class, the label only shows the text contained in the 'en' value. After implementing this fix, verify the change by logging into an external service using Canvas as an OAuth2 provider with a non-empty scope to confirm the checkbox correctly displays “Remember my authorization for this service.”
