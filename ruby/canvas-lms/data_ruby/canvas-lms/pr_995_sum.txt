The issue being addressed by the PR is that VeriCite Advanced Settings in the Assignment tool get overridden by Turnitin settings after the first submission is made to the assignment. This regression was introduced by a specific commit. The solution involves ensuring VeriCite settings are retained after submissions. Steps to verify this fix include:

1. Confirm that the test plan associated with the specified commit works as intended.
2. Create a VeriCite assignment ensuring all advanced settings are enabled, specifically making sure only VeriCite is active.
3. Edit the assignment to verify VeriCite advanced settings remain unchanged.
4. Submit to the assignment as a student, wait for the cron job completion, and then edit the assignment to check the VeriCite settings are still intact.

Also, ensure removal of the .DS_Store files and rebase to the current state before proceeding with testing.
