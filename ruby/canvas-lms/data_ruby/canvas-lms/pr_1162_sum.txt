**Instruction:**

Integrate a new custom variable `term_name=$Canvas.term.name` into the external tools' variable substitutions. Update the relevant test to include this capability, ensuring `custom_term_name` is correctly part of the launch request. Specifically, address the failure in `spec/lib/lti/capabilities_helper_spec.rb:106` by adding `Canvas.term.name` to the expected supported capabilities.
