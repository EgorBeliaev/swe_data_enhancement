Your commit message doesn't meet the standards outlined in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/blob/stable/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-pull-requests).  If you'd update this, we can get this pulled in and get the code review process started.\n\nConsidering this is a bugfix, it might indicate that we really need spec coverage of some functionality that clearly wasn't covered in the initial contribution, but probably should have been. It doesn't look like we have view specs for the similar Turnitin view, but it is covered by a couple selenium tests. At a minimum, we should probably consider similar selenium specs for this VeriCite view, but ideally it would be better if this was covered by view specs.\n"
