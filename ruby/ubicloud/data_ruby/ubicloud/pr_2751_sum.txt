Title: Improve CLI `vm list` Command

Instructions for the programmer:

1. Ensure consistent column widths in the `vm list` command output.
2. Enable headers by default in the command output.
3. Allow specification of fields using a single option (e.g., `-f name,ip4`).
4. Adjust column spacing to have more than one space between them, with two spaces recommended for improved readability.
