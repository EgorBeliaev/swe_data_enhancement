The theory is that, kubernetes community usually are\r\nnot interested in the actual size of the nodes, and slap cluster\r\nautoscaler to handle the number of nodes.\r\n\r\nUsually, even less important, is the storage size of the nodes, so\r\nthat's left as null-able, as usually clover picks the lowest available\r\nstorage size of the selected compute size by default, so can we."
