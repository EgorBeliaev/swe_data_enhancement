The main change to be made in the repository involves updating the command format for CLI VM operations using a routing tree approach. The specific instructions are as follows:

1. Adjust CLI commands such that the options directly follow the `vm-name` and precede the subcommand. Use the following format:
   - `vm location vm-name -4 ssh -A --`
   - `vm location vm-name -6 sftp -A`
   - `vm location vm-name -u username scp -r local-path :remote-path`

2. In the `ssh` command, keep the `--` to separate SSH options from arguments due to parsing limitations.

3. Ensure in the `scp` command, the order of options and arguments is switched to have options precede arguments. Implement: 
   - `vm location vm-name -u username scp -r local-path :remote-path`

4. Implement changes in the `Rodish` library to accommodate the new option parsing logic where `ssh`, `sftp`, and `scp` act as implied `--` to terminate option parsing.

5. Consider applying this approach to other cases for consistency and internal simplicity.

These changes are targeting improvement in ergonomic command formatting, enhancing the backspace (`C-w`) usability, and maintaining closeness to conventional command patterns.
