        "body": "- **Increase E2E timeout from 40m to 50m**\n  We recently added E2E tests for the PostgreSQL service and VM slices.\n  These tests have increased the overall duration of the E2E tests. 40\n  minutes is no longer enough for them to finish. I\u2019m raising the timeout\n  to 50 minutes to allow more time for completion.\n  \n\n- **Run E2E tests every 2 hours**\n  Right now, we run E2E tests every hour, but they take 40 minutes to\n  complete. Since we have only one VM host for the tests, we can only run\n  one test at a time. Our developers also run E2E tests to check their\n  branches, so running them every hour doesn't give enough time for\n  developers to do their tests. I think it's okay to run E2E tests every 2\n  hours.\n  "
