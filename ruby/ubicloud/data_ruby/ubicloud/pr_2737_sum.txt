Issue with the repository:

The Load Balancer (LB) healthcheck logic was incorrectly using the private IPv4 address when dealing with subnets larger than /32. The update ensures that the LB healthcheck now supports VMs with larger subnets and selects the correct IP address. Additionally, the NIC serializer issue was also resolved to return the correct address based on the provided netmask. 

Instruction for the programmer:

1. Update the Load Balancer healthcheck logic to correctly identify and use the appropriate private IPv4 address for VMs, even when they belong to a subnet larger than /32.
2. Amend the NIC serializer functionality to ensure it returns the correct address based on the given netmask.
3. Update the commit message header to: "Fix LB healthchecks by finding the correct IP for subnet-allocated K8s VMs."
