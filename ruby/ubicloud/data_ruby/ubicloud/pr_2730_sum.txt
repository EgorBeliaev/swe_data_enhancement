Add a query parameterization analysis feature to the repository. This involves analyzing queries issued during testing for parameterization status. Implement the following steps:

1. Introduce a rake task: "rake check_query_parameterization".
2. Implement functionality to log all queries during the tests.
3. Develop a script to analyze the logged queries and generate the file `sql_query_parameterization_analysis.txt`.
4. Ensure the summary of the analysis includes:
   - Missed parameterizations
   - Parameterized queries
   - Non-parameterized queries, not expected to be parameterized
5. Modify SQL generation by updating `column IN (value_list)` to `column = ANY(array_expr::type[])` to ensure consistency and prevent variation in SQL when using arrays.

Additionally, this PR addresses missed parameterization opportunities with SQL queries during testing, ensuring better accuracy and security in query handling.
