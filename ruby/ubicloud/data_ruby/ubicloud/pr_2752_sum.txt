### Instructions for the Programmer

1. **Enhanced Error Messaging**:
   - Implement a custom error message feature for invalid arguments within the `Rodish` framework.
   - Extend current functionality to display expected argument names in addition to the number of arguments or ranges.

2. **Update Underlying Support**:
   - Enhance the support to incorporate clearer error messages indicating missing parameters, as referenced in the provided issue comment link.
   - Prepare the framework to be updated for `ubi` CLI commands after successful merges, avoiding current PR conflicts.

3. **Flexibility in Error Messages**:
   - Consider making the `invalid_args_message` more flexible by using a `proc` instead of a string, allowing differentiated error messages based on the number of arguments passed (e.g., different messages for 1 vs 0 arguments when more are required).

4. **Conflict Awareness**:
   - Anticipate possible conflicts with other open PRs, ensuring that they are resolved easily upon integrating these changes.

This PR enhances error feedback by allowing specification of expected argument names in error messages and prepares for further updates to CLI commands.
