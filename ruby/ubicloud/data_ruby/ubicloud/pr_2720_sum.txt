Update the `EmailRenderer` by converting it to a Roda app utilizing the mailer plugin. Key changes include:

1. Utilize Roda's render plugin to optimize template caching and compilation, reducing the creation of new `Tilt::ErubiTemplate` objects.
2. Implement `part` for simpler rendering using locals.
3. Move `EmailRenderer` to a separate file to ensure proper reloading.
4. Skip the rendering of the email stylesheet, including the file directly as it contains no ERB code.
5. Set fixed locals for email templates to enforce valid local provisioning.
6. Remove the redundant empty `<style>` tag from the email layout.

Note: Update is needed for invoice specs to include an email; the mail library requires recipients for email delivery.
