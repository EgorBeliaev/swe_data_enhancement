**Instructions for Update:**

- Implement a `log` method within specifications to facilitate query logging for debugging specific blocks of code.
- This method should allow encapsulation of code in tests where query logging is desired, providing targeted debugging capabilities.
- Adjust test cases such that any code needing query logging is wrapped with the `log` method:
  ```ruby
  it "should do something" do
    setup_code

    log do
      code_you_are_trying_to_debug
    end

    # ...
  end
  ```
- Ensure the current mechanism using `DATABASE_LOGGER_LEVEL` is complemented by this method to avoid enabling logging globally when unnecessary.
