Without this, you need to use the DATABASE_LOGGER_LEVEL environment variable, which turns on query logging for everything, making it significantly more difficult to focus on what you are trying to debug.\r\n\r\nTo use this, inside the spec, wrap the code you want in the log method:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  it \"should do something\" do\r\n    setup_code\r\n\r\n    log do\r\n      code_you_are_trying_to_debug\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    # ...\r\n  end\r\n```"
