**Instruction for Implementation:**

1. **Objective**: Modify the process of route creation associated with a new Linux address.

2. **Change Details**:
   - **Use `noprefixroute`**: This option should be utilized to prevent the automatic creation of a corresponding Linux route when a new Linux address is added using `ip addr`.
   - **Manually Add Route**: Create a new route explicitly using the `via` keyword to handle packet routing via the gateway inside the subnet.

3. **Additional Context**:
   - Initially, there was confusion regarding the functionality of `noprefixroute`. It is confirmed that upon reevaluation, `noprefixroute` works correctly to suppress automatic routes.

4. **Commit Note**:
   - The changes have been cherry-picked. Ensure synchronization with the relevant base branch if required.
