**Instruction for Change:**

- Avoid treating a list containing string values as a text array.
  
**Issue Being Fixed:**

- The current implementation treats a list of string values as a text array, which leads to inconsistencies in query SQL depending on the number of array elements. The proposed change addresses this issue by correcting the way these lists are handled.
