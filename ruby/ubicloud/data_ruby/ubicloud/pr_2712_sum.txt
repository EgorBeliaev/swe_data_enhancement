**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Update E2E Timeout:**
   - Increase the End-to-End (E2E) testing timeout from 40 minutes to 50 minutes. This change accommodates the additional time required for the recently added E2E tests for the PostgreSQL service and VM slices.

2. **Adjust E2E Testing Schedule:**
   - Modify the schedule for running E2E tests to every 2 hours instead of every hour. This adjustment is due to the limitation of having a single VM host, which allows only one test to run at a time, and to provide sufficient time for developers to run their E2E tests on branches.
