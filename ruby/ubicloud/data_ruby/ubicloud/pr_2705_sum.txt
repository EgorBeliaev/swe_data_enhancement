**Instruction for Programmer:**

Add an option to specify custom CIDR ranges for IPv4 subnets in the codebase. Modify the subnet creation logic to accommodate larger subnet masks, preferably /16, for Kubernetes CNI. Ensure each VM can host pods and assign /24 ranges, providing at most 256 IPs per VM from the subnet. Adjust calculations so that based on the given subnet mask, the minimum of 32 or the subnet mask plus 8 determines the IPs per VM, with /32 IPs assigned for a /26 subnet mask.
