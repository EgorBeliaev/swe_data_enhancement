**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Feature Addition**: Implement a new setting to hide the HUD while the module is active.
2. **Conditional Logic**: Ensure when the HUD is hidden, the "show hands" setting should not be available as the logic is tied to HUD rendering.
3. **Manual Override**: Allow the user to manually toggle the HUD on/off while the module is active without automatically retoggling when the module is deactivated.
4. **Key Event Review**: Consider removing the mouse button event associated with `GLFW_KEY_F1`, as typical mouse actions are unlikely to trigger this event.
