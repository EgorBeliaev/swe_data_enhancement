**Instruction:**

1. Modify the handling of the c2s custom payload packet in version 1.20.5 to prevent changing internals, which initially led to the breaking of criticals.
2. Implement a fix where the packet is canceled, and a new modified packet is sent without triggering `PacketEvent.Send`, thereby avoiding an infinite loop.
3. Consider refactoring the code to post the `ClientConnection` with the event, similar to `PacketEvent.Receive`, instead of obtaining it from the connection screen.
