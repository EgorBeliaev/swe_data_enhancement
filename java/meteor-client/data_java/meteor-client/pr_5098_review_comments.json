        "body": "## Type of change\n\n- [x] Bug fix\n- [ ] New feature\n\n## Description\n\nMakes hud elements tick when they are in the editor as well as when active in-game to fix a bug with elements that set their size in the tick event. Previously if you disabled the element and restarted your game, the size of the element would be reduced to a 1x1 square and would not update unless you managed to click on it to re-enable it.\n\n## Related issues\n\nN/A\n\n# How Has This Been Tested?\n\nTested via disabling potion hud, active modules hud and closing/reopening the game. Sizing updates correctly, no noticeable issues\n\n# Checklist:\n\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project.\n- [x] I have added comments to my code in more complex areas.\n- [x] I have tested the code in both development and production environments.\n"
