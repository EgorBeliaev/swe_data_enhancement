**Issue Description:**

Certain settings in the Baritone module of the repository require maximum values to prevent unexpected errors. Specifically, a setting like `pathCutoffFactor` may cause `index out of bounds` exceptions when its value is set above 1.0.

**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Add Maximum Values to Settings:**
   - Implement a `maxValue` for the `pathCutoffFactor` setting and possibly other related settings.

2. **Consideration for Double Setting:**
   - No need to adjust `DoubleSetting` according to the author's feedback.

3. **Slider vs. Max Value:**
   - Transition from setting `sliderMax` to defining a `max` value for clarity and functionality.

4. **Follow Project Guidelines:**
   - Ensure the changes adhere to the project's style guidelines.

5. **Testing:**
   - Verify the implementation in both development and production environments to ensure no further issues arise.

**Potential Follow-Up:**

- Consider filing a bug report with the Baritone repository if similar issues are not addressed.
