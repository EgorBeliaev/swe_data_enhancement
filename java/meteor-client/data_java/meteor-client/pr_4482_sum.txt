**Instruction for Implementation:**

Integrate glow ESP feature to enhance compatibility with shaders in our project. Utilize the vanilla glow effect to ensure mobs emit a glow similar to the glow potion effect, as tested effectively with Iris and Sodium shaders. Ensure that the feature integrates seamlessly with our coding standards, adding comments where necessary, and verify functionality across both development and production settings.
