**Instruction for Fixing the Issue in BetterChat.java:**

1. **File and Line Correction:**
   - Locate `BetterChat.java`.
   - Remove the redundant line 463, which is a bugged duplicate of line 462.

2. **Expected Outcome:**
   - The removal should correct the distortion of player head images in the chat.

**Purpose:**
- This change will prevent grotesque stretching of player heads by eliminating unnecessary duplication supposedly related to the 3D layer.
