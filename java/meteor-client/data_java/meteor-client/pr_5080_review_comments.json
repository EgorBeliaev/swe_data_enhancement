        "body": "## Type of change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix\r\n- [x] New feature\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nAdds a setting to hide the hud while the module is active. Activating this hides the \"show hands\" setting since that logic is encapsulated in hud rendering. If the user manually turns the hud on/off while the module is active it will not try to retoggle the hud when deactivated.\r\n\r\n## Related issues\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f2ea8c0-e652-4f74-be5d-6543459d4712\r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project.\r\n- [x] I have added comments to my code in more complex areas.\r\n- [x] I have tested the code in both development and production environments.\r\n"
