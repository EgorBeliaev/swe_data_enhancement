**Instruction for Programmer:**

Fix the issue where entities in singleplayer mode were incorrectly able to ignore the world border despite the WorldBorderMixin. Test the fix by creating a world, setting the world border to 50 units, enabling collisions and the ignore-border option, and verifying that entities cannot pass through the border in both single and multiplayer modes. Make sure your code adheres to the project's style guidelines, and ensure it operates correctly in both development and production environments.
