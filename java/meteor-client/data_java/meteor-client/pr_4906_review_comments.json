This PR forces re-acceleration and fixes the rubber banding. This could potentially be a separate setting.\r\n\r\n## Related issues\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3983ba0a-469b-462c-ba5f-457d0f437e3c\r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project.\r\n- [ ] ~I have added comments to my code in more complex areas.~ No complex additions\r\n- [x] I have tested the code in both development and production environments.\r\n"
