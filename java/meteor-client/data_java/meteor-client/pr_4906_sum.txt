**Issue Description:**
When "No Unloaded Chunks" is enabled, entering an unloaded chunk sets the player's velocity to zero, stopping re-acceleration and causing rubber banding. This negates the intended effect of the "acceleration" option for Elytra flight.

**Instructions for PR Changes:**
1. Modify the Elytra flight logic to ensure that once a player exits an unloaded chunk, their velocity is set to re-accelerate appropriately.
2. Address rubber banding issues by maintaining consistent acceleration to improve gameplay fluidity when crossing chunk borders.
3. Ensure changes are consistent with the current style guidelines of the project.
4. Conduct thorough testing in both development and production environments to confirm the problem is resolved without introducing new issues.
