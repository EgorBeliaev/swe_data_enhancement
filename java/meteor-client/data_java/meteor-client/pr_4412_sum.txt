**Instruction for the Programmer:**

- **Issue:** The method `getEnumConstants` can return null when invoked on enum constants that implement interfaces or abstract methods. This is due to the actual class of the constant being a synthetic class (e.g., `SomeEnum$1`) rather than the enum class itself.
  
- **Fix:** Replace the use of `getEnumConstants` on the result of `getClass()` with the use of `getDeclaringClass()` to obtain the actual enum class where `getEnumConstants` should be correctly called.

- **Example:** Instead of using `SomeEnumConstant.getClass().getEnumConstants()`, use `SomeEnumConstant.getDeclaringClass().getEnumConstants()`.

- **Testing & Verification:** The fix has been validated by the author while developing an Add-On, and the code follows the project's style guidelines, with appropriate comments in complex areas. Ensure the code works in both development and production environments.
