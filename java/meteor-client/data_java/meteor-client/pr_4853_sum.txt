**Issue:**
The PR addresses a bug where passing an invalid slot number to `player.get_item` causes a `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This occurs when attempting to access an index outside the valid range of an array.

**Instructions:**
1. Implement a check within `player.get_item` to validate if the input slot number falls within the valid index range of the array. If the slot number is invalid, handle the error gracefully to prevent a crash.
2. Make sure that your code adheres to the existing style guidelines of the project.
3. Add necessary comments for the implemented code, especially around the input validation logic.
4. Although testing couldnâ€™t be completed by the author due to environment constraints, ensure to test the solution in both development and production environments once you have the setup.
