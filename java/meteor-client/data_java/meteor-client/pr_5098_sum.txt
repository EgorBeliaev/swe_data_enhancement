**Instructions for the Change:**

Update the HUD elements to tick both in the editor and when active in-game. Ensure that elements, which configure their size during the tick event, maintain their dimensions even when disabled and the game is restarted. Test these changes by disabling potion HUD and active modules HUD, then closing and reopening the game to confirm that sizing updates correctly without any issues.
