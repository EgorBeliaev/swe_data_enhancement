**Instruction for Repository Update:**

Replace the `Meteorexecutor` thread pool usage in `BlockESP` with a single worker thread to remove lag spikes when enabling `BlockESP`. Ensure the changes adhere to the projectâ€™s style guidelines, include comments in complex code areas, and are thoroughly tested in both development and production environments. Note: Consider whether a similar implementation might be beneficial for `TunnelESP` due to existing lag issues when toggling it on.
