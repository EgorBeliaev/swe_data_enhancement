**Instruction:**

Implement a new feature by adding an "auto wasp" module. This module should include a command that allows players to automatically follow others using an elytra. Ensure that the implementation adheres to project style guidelines and includes comments for complex areas. Test the new module on both a local LAN server and an online paper server.
