(Unfortunately, one such message is generated when reverting GitHub PRs \ud83d\ude44). An example of such message is the one used in this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTry to debug unusual commit messages such as with \"quotes (#1874) like\" this in the message\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere the combination of `(` inside `\"` causes the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/home/vsts/work/_temp/a34b75bc-d39f-4087-98d3-a314284dde8c.sh: line 3: syntax error near unexpected token `('\r\n/home/vsts/work/_temp/a34b75bc-d39f-4087-98d3-a314284dde8c.sh: line 3: `echo \"COMMIT_MESSAGE: Try to debug unusual commit messages such as with \"quotes (#1874) like\" this in the message\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did not found any way to automatically escape this in the Azure pipelines. So to avoid this, I marked the step that logs the variables to continue even on error. As it is logging step only, it should be fine and it will not block us in the future as it did with the 0.45.0-rc2."
