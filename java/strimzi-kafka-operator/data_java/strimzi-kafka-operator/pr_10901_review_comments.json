        "body": "### Type of change\r\n\r\n- Refactoring\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR does a minor cleanup to the Topic Operator:\r\n* It removes the unused method for creating the Kubernetes client\r\n* It unifies the way the naming of the user-agent and the client is done in the Kubernetes Client\r\n* Removes the unnecessary delegate method from the `TopicOperatorUtil` class\r\n* It updates the timing configurations of the informer:\r\n    * It changes the resynch-check interval to 30 second (that means the resynch happens somewhere between the `reconciliationInterval` and `reconciliation interval + 30 seconds`). It was previously set to 2 seconds, which made the window smaller, but also meant we did the check very often. 30 seconds seem sufficient to me, but we can change it if anyone disagrees.\r\n    * It does not seem to make sense to add the interval in addition to the reconciliation interval in the event handler, that seems to make little sense.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure all tests pass\r\n- [x] Try your changes from Pod inside your Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster, not just locally"
