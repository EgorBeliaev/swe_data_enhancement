        "body": "### Type of change\r\n\r\n- Task\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe `externalBootstrapServiceName` in the `KafkaResources` class is a relict from the times long gone as we do not have any special _external service_ now (all listeners are named by the user and have their own types). It should not be in the `KafkaResources` class that is in the API (it was also used in tests only anyway). This PR removes it.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure all tests pass\r\n- [x] Try your changes from Pod inside your Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster, not just locally"
