**Instruction for Changes:**

Fix the issue where routes are not deleted after a `type: route` listener is removed. Perform the check for cluster route support at a lower level in the code to ensure compatibility with non-OpenShift clusters. Add unit tests for Route management to cover any missing areas and verify that they pass.
