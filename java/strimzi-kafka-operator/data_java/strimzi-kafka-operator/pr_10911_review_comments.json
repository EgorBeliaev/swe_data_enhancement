        "body": "The regression test failed due to IllegalArgumentException when calling `URI.create()` on a URL string that contains a connector name. This is because MirrorMaker connector name contains \"->\" : https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/blob/de30da5331272b0ceeeddb1aec2f83cda5746d5d/cluster-operator/src/main/java/io/strimzi/operator/cluster/model/KafkaMirrorMaker2Connectors.java#L146\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we have to encode the \"->\" either using URLEncoder or by replacing it manually with encoded value before calling `URI.create()` . \r\n\r\nBut can we also change the MirrorMaker connector name to not contain the invalid character so that the connectors are recreated with a new name during the reconciliation? I'm not sure if this should change in the PR or in a separate PR though. \r\n\r\n(cc: @scholzj @ppatierno )"

        "body": "I'm not sure you can easily change it. It would mean that the connector will need to be deleted and recreated with new name etc. We would need to clarify what exactly might be the impact of this (how long does it take? Will there be duplicate messages? etc.) Also, user might have workflows build based on the current names. So I'm not sure it is impossible to change the names, but it would certainly require some detailed considerations."
