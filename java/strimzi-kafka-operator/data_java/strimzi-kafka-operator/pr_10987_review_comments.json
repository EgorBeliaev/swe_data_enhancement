        "body": "### Type of change\r\n\r\n- Refactoring\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe `KRaftUtils.validateKafkaCrForKRaft` does contain only one remaining validation - that the `.spec` section is not null. This validation is not really used, because we check this already in the `AbstractOperator` class. So this method can be removed. \r\n\r\nThat would leave the `KRaftUtils` class with only one remaining method - `validateMetadataVersion` - which validates that the KRaft metadata version is at least 3.3 (required for KRaft). This is used by the `KafkaCluster` class and can be moved there. That is done in this PR and the `KRaftUtils` class is removed.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Write tests\r\n- [x] Make sure all tests pass\r\n- [x] Try your changes from Pod inside your Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster, not just locally"
