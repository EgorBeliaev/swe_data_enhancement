Refactor the Kubernetes Client usage in Topic Operator by executing the following changes:

1. Remove the unused method for creating the Kubernetes client.
2. Standardize the naming of the user-agent and the client in the Kubernetes Client.
3. Eliminate the unnecessary delegate method from the `TopicOperatorUtil` class.
4. Update the timing configurations of the informer:
   - Adjust the resynch-check interval to 30 seconds, allowing the resynch to occur within the `reconciliationInterval` and `reconciliation interval + 30 seconds`. Previously, this was set to 2 seconds.
   - Ensure the event handler does not mistakenly add the interval to the reconciliation interval.

Ensure all tests pass and validate changes within your Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster environment, not just locally, before submission.
