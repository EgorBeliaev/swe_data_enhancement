**Instructions for Refactoring the `KRaftUtils` Class:**

1. **Remove Method:**
   - Delete the `KRaftUtils.validateKafkaCrForKRaft` method, as its validation (checking if `.spec` is not null) is already performed in the `AbstractOperator` class.

2. **Relocate Method:**
   - Move the `validateMetadataVersion` method from `KRaftUtils` class to the `KafkaCluster` class since it ensures the KRaft metadata version is at least 3.3, which is a necessary requirement for KRaft.

3. **Delete Class:**
   - Fully remove the `KRaftUtils` class once the above changes are implemented, as it will be left empty. 

4. **Testing:**
   - Ensure new tests are written if necessary, and verify all existing tests pass.
   - Validate changes within a Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster environment, not only locally.
