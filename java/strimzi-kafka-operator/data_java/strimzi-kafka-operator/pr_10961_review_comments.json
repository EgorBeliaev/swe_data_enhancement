This helps to avoid confusion among users why are they seeing some TRACE messages in the Kafka logs from Strimzi when they did not enable them.\r\n\r\n_(While Kafka 4.0 will have a new logging configuration based on Log4j2, this will be still useful for Kafka 3.9.0)_\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Try your changes from Pod inside your Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster, not just locally"
