That is done in this PR. It also addresses various IDE warnings in this class. There should be no change in the output it produces, so no changes to tests are needed.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure all tests pass\r\n- [x] Try your changes from Pod inside your Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster, not just locally"
