### Instructions for PR Implementation:

1. **Move Bridge Configuration:**
   - Shift the bridge configuration to be generated by the operator within a ConfigMap. Use the existing ConfigMap that handles metrics and logging but include a different entry in the data section.
   - Mount this ConfigMap on the bridge pod and ensure it loads correctly from there.

2. **Temporary Changes:**
   - Implement a temporary change in `.azure/templates/steps/system_test_general.yaml` to utilize a custom bridge image which avoids script-based configuration generation.
   - Revert this temporary change before merging the PR, as itâ€™s solely for running system tests (STs).

3. **Accompanying PR:**
   - Coordinate this PR with strimzi/strimzi-kafka-bridge#963. Ensure the bridge PR is merged and bridge version 0.32.0 is released before merging this one.

4. **Testing:**
   - Add and run tests to validate the changes.
   - Ensure all tests pass in both Kubernetes and OpenShift environments.

5. **Changelog Update:**
   - Make necessary entries in the CHANGELOG.md to reflect the changes made by this PR.

6. **Addressed Comments and Issues:**
   - Resolve all comments and issues raised by reviewers, notably by `scholzj` related to values.yaml and HelmResource.java which are temporary.
   - Revert changes related to these files before the merge to deal with system tests (STs).

7. **Version Control:**
   - Set `bridge.version` to "latest" during testing, and ensure deployment files are updated appropriately.
   - Revert this after the bridge 0.32.0 release and document it by opening an issue if necessary.

### Issue Being Fixed:

This PR is addressing issue #10959 by moving the bridge configuration responsibility to the operator, thus streamlining the setup and management process by utilizing an existing ConfigMap. This change aims to enhance configurability and reduce reliance on custom bridge images/scripts.
