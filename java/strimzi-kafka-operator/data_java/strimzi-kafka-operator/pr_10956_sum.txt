**Instruction:**  
Modify the CI pipeline script to not fail on commit messages containing special characters that cause syntax errors. Specifically, alter the step that logs variable values to continue execution even if an error occurs. This change ensures that the logging step does not block the pipeline, especially for scenarios like reverting GitHub PRs where commits might unintentionally contain problematic characters such as quotes followed by parentheses.
