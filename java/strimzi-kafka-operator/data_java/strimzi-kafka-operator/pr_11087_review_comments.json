        "body": "### Type of change\r\n\r\n- Refactoring\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen declaring an external listener, the corresponding service gets a `statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name` label within its selector to select the corresponding pod (which has the same label as well).\r\nThis seems to be a leftover from our upgrade removal from StatefulSets which is not in place anymore.\r\nThis PR replace the `statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name` with the `strimzi.io/pod-name` on the service declaration so that it can continue to work and select the right pod.\r\nAt the same time, it removes `statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name` from the pod definition as well (NOTE: the  `strimzi.io/pod-name` is already there of course).\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure all tests pass\r\n- [x] Try your changes from Pod inside your Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster, not just locally\r\n"
