**Instruction for the Programmer:**

Optimize memory usage in the Kafka cluster operator when dealing with large Kubernetes clusters by modifying how node addresses are collected for the status update:

1. Instead of listing all nodes and matching them with Kafka pods, directly obtain nodes one-by-one using Kubernetes GET API calls for each broker pod.
2. Extract the node addresses necessary for the status section from these individual GET calls.
3. This approach sacrifices some CPU efficiency for greater memory efficiency, which is beneficial in scenarios with large Kubernetes clusters but smaller Kafka clusters.
4. Ensure to write tests for these changes and verify that all tests pass.
5. Validate the changes within Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters after implementing, beyond just local testing.
