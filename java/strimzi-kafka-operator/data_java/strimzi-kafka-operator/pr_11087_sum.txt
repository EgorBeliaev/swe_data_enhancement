**Condensed Instruction:**

1. **Refactor Labels:**
   - Replace the `statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name` label with `strimzi.io/pod-name` on service declarations.
   - Remove the `statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name` label from pod definitions.

2. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Ensure all tests pass.
   - Verify changes within both Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters.
   - Conduct local upgrade tests to ensure functionality remains intact.
   - Run and confirm the regression tests, including upgrade tests, are successful.

This PR is addressing the leftover label from previous StatefulSets configurations by switching to the correct label that matches the current structure.
