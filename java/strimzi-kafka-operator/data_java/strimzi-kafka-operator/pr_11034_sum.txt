**Instruction for Repository Update:**

1. **Remove Storage Overrides Support:**
   - Implement the removal of support for storage class overrides in the `KafkaNodePool` resources.
   - Ensure storage overrides specified for different nodes are ignored, utilizing only the `StorageClass` from the persistent volume configuration.

2. **Handle New Cluster Scenarios:**
   - Modify new cluster configurations to ignore storage class overrides in `KafkaNodePool` resources.
   - Add warning messages to resource conditions and logs for deprecated fields.

3. **Maintain Existing Cluster Functionality:**
   - Existing PVCs with storage class from overrides should remain unchanged.
   - New PVCs should ignore storage overrides and use the storage class directly from persistent storage.

4. **User Guidance:**
   - Advise users to use different node pools for different storage classes if they require separate configurations.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Write and execute appropriate tests to verify changes.
   - Ensure all tests pass.
   - Update the relevant documentation and `CHANGELOG.md`.
   - Validate the changes within Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters.
