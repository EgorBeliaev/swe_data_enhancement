### Instructions for Changes:

1. **Remove Vertx Future:**
   - Replace `Vertx Future` with `CompletableFuture` in `KafkaConnectApi`.
   - Update all related classes and tests accordingly.

2. **Address Regression Test Failure:**
   - Resolve the `IllegalArgumentException` occurring due to the `URI.create()` call on URL strings containing a connector name with "->".
   - Encode the "->" character using `URLEncoder` or replace it manually with its encoded value before making the `URI.create()` call.
   - Consider the implications of changing the MirrorMaker connector name to remove the "->" character. If pursued, ensure connectors are recreated with a new valid name and assess the potential effects on workflows, duplication, and system impacts.
