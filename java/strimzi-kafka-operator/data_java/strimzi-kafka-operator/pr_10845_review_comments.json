        "body": "### Type of change\r\n\r\n- Bugfix\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, when a user has a `type: route` listener and removes it, the routes are never deleted. This is because the protection against trying to use the Route support on clusters where we don't support Routes (non-OpenShift clusters) is on the wrong level.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by doing the check on a lower level of the code. It also adds unit tests for the Route management that were missing so far.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Write tests\r\n- [x] Make sure all tests pass\r\n- [x] Try your changes from Pod inside your Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster, not just locally"
