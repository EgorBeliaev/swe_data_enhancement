**Instruction for Changes in the Repository:**

Remove the `externalBootstrapServiceName` method from the `KafkaResources` class. This method is outdated as there is no longer a special _external service_ and all listeners are now user-defined with their own types. The method is only used in tests and should be eliminated from the API. Ensure all tests pass and verify changes in both Kubernetes and OpenShift environments, not just locally.
