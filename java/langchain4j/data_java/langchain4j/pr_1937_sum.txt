Improve logging and streamline dependencies as follows:

1. **Logging Configuration**:  
   - Modify `.mvn/jvm.config` to set the logging level to `info`.

2. **Dependency Cleanup**:
   - In `langchain4j-ollama/pom.xml`, remove duplicate dependencies:
     - `mockito-core`
     - `mockito-junit-jupiter`
   - In `langchain4j-parent/pom.xml`, remove the redundant dependency on `langchain4j` test-jar.

**Checklist Not Completed**:
- Unit and integration tests have not been added.
- Tests for `core` and `main` modules have not been manually verified.
- Documentation updates are pending.
- Example additions are pending.
- Spring Boot starters update is not addressed.
- New module additions in `pom.xml` files are pending.
- Embedding store integration checks and verification are pending.
