The changes needed for the MariaDB database store implementation in the repository are as follows:

1. **Synchronization with Main Branch:**
   - Ensure the branch is synchronized with the main branch before proceeding with the merge.

2. **Integration Test Issues:**
   - Resolve any failing integration tests before considering a merge as noted by `@kpavlov`.

3. **Metadata Storage Handling:**
   - Review and potentially address the tight coupling with MariaDB's SQL syntax, considering future database flexibility.
   - Evaluate potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in metadata handling and ensure proper parameter sanitization.

4. **Generic JDBC Abstraction Proposal:**
   - Consider the suggestion by `@kpavlov` to implement a generic `JdbcEmbeddingStore` or `AbstractJdbcEmbeddingStore` to avoid redundancy in relational database embedding store implementations.

5. **Test Case Coverage:**
   - Ensure both positive and negative test scenarios are sufficiently covered, particularly focusing on metadata storage, SQL syntax validation, scalability, and concurrency issues.
   - Include tests for edge cases such as large datasets and special characters in metadata.

6. **License Compliance:**
   - Implement the following configuration in the POM file for acceptable licenses:
     ```xml
     <configuration>
         <acceptableLicenses combine.children="append">
             <license>
                 <name>LGPL-2.1-or-later</name>
                 <url>https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1-or-later.html</url>
             </license>
         </acceptableLicenses>
     </configuration>
     ```

7. **Resolve Code Quality Issues:**
   - Address any outstanding issues reported by code analysis tools like Codacy, except for expected issues.

These instructions should guide developers in making the necessary adjustments for a successful merge and a robust implementation of the MariaDB database store.
