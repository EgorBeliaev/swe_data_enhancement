**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Objective:** Refactor the `LC4J-open-ai` module to remove Lombok annotations.

2. **Changes to Implement:**
   - Replace Lombok annotations with manual builder methods to enhance control and readability.
   - Introduce the `@EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable` annotation in tests to enable them conditionally, depending on the presence of the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
   - Fix the issue of insecure API key logging in the `toString` method generated in the open-ai module.

3. **Testing:**
   - Ensure no breaking changes are introduced.
   - Add unit and integration tests for the changes (not fully completed according to the checklist).
   - Manually run all unit and integration tests within the changed module to confirm they pass successfully.

4. **Note:**
   - Avoid modifying behavior, such as `OpenAiTokenizer` creation, in the context of this refactoring task.

The PR contributes to addressing issue #1636.
