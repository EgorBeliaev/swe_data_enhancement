### Instruction for Programmer:

1. **CI Environment Setup**: 
   - Add `setup-jbang` action to the CI pipeline to ensure `jbang` executable is installed for running integration tests.

2. **Property Override**: 
   - Implement a system property `jbang.command` to override the command used to execute `jbang`. If not provided, default to using `jbang`.

3. **Windows Compatibility**:
   - Fix the file path retrieval issue when the script is run on Windows:
     - Use `getSystemResource("tools_mcp_server.java").getFile().substring(isWindows() ? 1 : 0).replace("/", File.separator);` to reliably handle file paths across platforms.

4. **Wiremock vs. jbang**:
   - Maintain the use of `jbang` instead of Wiremock due to limitations of server-sent events support and the need for a unified testing approach.

5. **Default Command Adjustment for Windows**:
   - Consider using `jbang.cmd` instead of `jbang` as the default command if the environment is detected as Windows.
