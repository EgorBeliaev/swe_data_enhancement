Remove Lombok annotations in the `LC4J-mistral-ai` and replace with manual builder methods for API classes in the `../internal/api` package. Ensure all POJOs in this folder utilize the builder pattern and remove unnecessary `public` generic constructors, using private constructors with the builder parameter instead. Do not override `toString()` in static builder classes; properly format `toString()` using `StringJoiner` for all API classes. Remove the `toBuilder()` method and use `builder()` instead for creating instances. Additionally, ensure compliance with the existing standards for categories and moderation classes such as `MistralCategoryScores`. Fix any deserialization issues in tests by ensuring default constructors are present where required. Address feedback to ensure builders are properly formatted in API classes and resolve all test failures related to default constructor issues.
