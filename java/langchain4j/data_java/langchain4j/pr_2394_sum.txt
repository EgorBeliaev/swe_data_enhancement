**Instructions for Programmer:**

1. **McpTransport Interface Update**: Refactor the `McpTransport` interface by consolidating operations into `executeOperationWithResponse` and `executeOperationWithoutResponse` methods. Remove the methods `listTools`, `executeTool`, and `cancelOperation`.

2. **Ping Response Implementation**: Implement functionality to respond to server-initiated pings. Ensure test coverage includes responding to pings and client-server pong confirmations.

3. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Add positive test scenarios to ensure the client accurately responds to server pings, handles valid responses, and correctly processes cancellation notifications.
   - Include negative test scenarios to verify client stability against invalid pings, mismatched response IDs, and transport layer failures.

4. **Corner Case Testing**:
   - Conduct tests with a large number of concurrent operations to check for resource limits and deadlocks.
   - Validate the client response to oversized ping IDs and simultaneous operations with incoming pings.

5. **Dependency and Debugging**:
   - Review dependencies to avoid circular dependency issues between `McpOperationHandler` and `McpTransport`.
   - Ensure the generic methods do not negatively impact debugging of operations.

This PR aims to enhance the generalization of operation handling and introduce server ping response functionality, along with addressing potential issues in concurrent handling and stability.
