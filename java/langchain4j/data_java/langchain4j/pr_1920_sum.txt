**Instructions:**

1. Change the access modifier of `should_filter_by_metadata_not` from default to protected in `EmbeddingStoreWithFilteringIT`.
2. Change the access modifier of `TEST_UUID2` from default to protected in `EmbeddingStoreIT`.

**Note:** Ensure that all unit and integration tests are manually run and pass successfully, both in the changed module and in the core and main modules. No breaking changes should be introduced, and documentation or examples should be added after the PR is reviewed and approved.
