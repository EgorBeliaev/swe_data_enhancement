The pull request addresses an issue in the Mistral integration where the `tool_call_id` parameter in tool messages is now mandatory, causing Mistral tests to fail with a 400 error. The following changes and improvements need to be made:

1. **Map `tool_call_id`:** Ensure that `tool_call_id` is correctly mapped in `MistralAiChatMessage` to satisfy Mistral's new requirements.

2. **Testing:**
   - Implement additional unit and/or integration tests for both positive and negative cases as suggested by the bot:
     - Positive case: Convert valid tool execution result messages to `MistralAiChatMessage` ensuring toolCallId, tool name, and content are correctly mapped.
     - Negative cases: Handle or throw exceptions gracefully for null or empty tool name/content in tool execution result messages.
     - Corner cases: Test with long or special characters in tool name/content ensuring toolCallId is correctly mapped.

3. **Documentation:** Add or update documentation to reflect these changes, as currently insufficient.

4. **Enum Update:** Introduce a new `MistralAiToolChoiceName` enum called `REQUIRED` and replace `ANY` with `REQUIRED` in:
   - `MistralAiChatModel.java` at line 163
   - `MistralAiStreamingChatModel.java` at line 156
   This change is related to tool choice logic and may need coordination with the PR introducing model-agnostic `ToolChoice`.

5. **General Consideration:** Ensure the `id()` method of `ToolExecutionResultMessage` does not return null/empty and handle such cases properly.

Future potential improvements include designing a more generic approach to handle tool call IDs for adaptability across different models.
