The Pull Request (PR) titled "migrate vespa to jackson + tests and refactorings" addresses the following key tasks:

1. **Update Java Version**: 
   - Raise the Java baseline from JDK 8 to JDK 17 to support the newest `vespa-feed-client`.

2. **Serialization Library Migration**: 
   - Migrate from using Gson to using Jackson for JSON serialization/deserialization.

3. **Code Refactoring**: 
   - Remove Lombok from the codebase.

4. **Integration Tests**: 
   - Implement the `VespaEmbeddingStoreIT` test.

5. **API Changes**: 
   - Support the new API method `search()` and deprecate `findRelevant`.

6. **Logging Enhancements**:
   - Add support for `logRequests` and `logResponses` parameters.

7. **Parameter Update**:
   - Make `keyPath` and `certPath` optional parameters.

8. **Method Addition**:
   - Add a new method `removeAll()`.

The PR closes issue #1681 and confirms that there are no breaking changes. The suggested changes have been tested, and all unit and integration tests have passed successfully. Documentation and examples will be added in a subsequent ticket. The PR also introduces changes in the `VespaEmbeddingStore`, requiring a `clusterName` parameter and adaptations for other refactorings. 

Note: Point 5, relating to `VespaEmbeddingStoreCloudIT`, will be handled separately outside this PR's scope.
