        "body": "## Issue\r\nAdds format consistency check for changed files. Closes #2109 \r\n\r\n## Change\r\n\r\n- Add [Spotless Maven plugin](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) for code java (eclipse java format) and pom.xml formatting\r\n- Added the `<project.root.dir>` property across multiple POM files to standardize the directory structure reference. This ensures consistent project configurations and reduces redundancy in defining the root project directory. Adjusted existing XML formatting minimally to accommodate the new property integration.\r\n- Cleanup duplicate settings in pgvector module\r\n- Updated pom.xml files were reformatted according to [defaults](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven#sortpom) + 4 spaces\r\n- Adding linting and formatting commands to the `Makefile`, updating the `pom.xml` files for better project configuration, and enhancing the `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines.\r\n\r\n## General checklist\r\n<!-- Please double-check the following points and mark them like this: [X] -->\r\n- [x] There are no breaking changes\r\n- [ ] I have added unit and integration tests for my change\r\n- [ ] I have manually run all the unit and integration tests in the module I have added/changed, and they are all green\r\n- [ ] I have manually run all the unit and integration tests in the [core](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j/tree/main/langchain4j-core) and [main](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j/tree/main/langchain4j) modules, and they are all green\r\n<!-- Before adding documentation and example(s) (below), please wait until the PR is reviewed and approved. -->\r\n- [ ] I have added/updated the [documentation](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j/tree/main/docs/docs)\r\n- [ ] I have added an example in the [examples repo](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j-examples) (only for \"big\" features)\r\n- [ ] I have added/updated [Spring Boot starter(s)](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j-spring) (if applicable)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist for adding new maven module\r\n<!-- Please double-check the following points and mark them like this: [X] -->\r\n- [ ] I have added my new module in the root `pom.xml` and `langchain4j-bom/pom.xml`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist for adding new embedding store integration\r\n<!-- Please double-check the following points and mark them like this: [X] -->\r\n- [ ] I have added a `{NameOfIntegration}EmbeddingStoreIT` that extends from either `EmbeddingStoreIT` or `EmbeddingStoreWithFilteringIT`\r\n- [ ] I have added a `{NameOfIntegration}EmbeddingStoreRemovalIT` that extends from `EmbeddingStoreWithRemovalIT`\r\n\r\n## Checklist for changing existing embedding store integration\r\n<!-- Please double-check the following points and mark them like this: [X] -->\r\n- [ ] I have manually verified that the `{NameOfIntegration}EmbeddingStore` works correctly with the data persisted using the latest released version of LangChain4j\r\n"
