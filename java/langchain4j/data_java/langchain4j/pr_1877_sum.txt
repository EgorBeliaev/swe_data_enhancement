**Instruction for Programmer:**

Enhance the DashScope by increasing compatibility for scenarios where both text and tool-call are present in the model's responses. Ensure that there are no breaking changes. Manual testing has been conducted for unit and integration tests specifically in the module altered, yielding successful results. However, unit and integration tests in the core and main modules have not been run. Additional testing and validation may be necessary if changes impact those areas.
