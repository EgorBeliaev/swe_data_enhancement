**Instruction for Programmer:**

Replace the use of OkHttp and Retrofit in the `GeminiService` with an implementation using Java 11's `HttpClient`. Ensure that:

- There are no breaking changes.
- Unit and integration tests are added and have been manually run, passing in the relevant module as well as the `core` and `main` modules.
- Hold off on adding or updating documentation, examples, or Spring Boot starter until PR is approved.

Optional Checklist Items (if applicable for new modules or integration):

- Add new module to the root `pom.xml` and `langchain4j-bom/pom.xml`.
- Add integration tests and verify backward compatibility for any changes in embedding store integrations.
