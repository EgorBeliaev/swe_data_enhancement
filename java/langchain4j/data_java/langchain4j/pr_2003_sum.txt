- **Implement `langchain4j-coherence` Module:** Create a new module for Oracle Coherence embedding store and chat memory store using Oracle Coherence Community Edition.
  
- **Testing:**
  - Add unit and integration tests (`CoherenceEmbeddingStoreIT` and `CoherenceEmbeddingStoreRemovalIT` classes).
  - Manually run all tests in the added/changed module to ensure they are green.
  - Note the `core` module code coverage issue (75% required, currently at 68%) unrelated to changes.

- **Documentation and Examples:**
  - Update documentation upon review and approval.
  - Delay submitting examples and Spring Boot starter until the PR is approved.

- **Maven Module Integration:**
  - Include the new module in the root `pom.xml` and `langchain4j-bom/pom.xml`.

- **Licensing:**
  - Maintain current project license, Apache 2.0, which is compatible with UPL 1.0 used by Oracle.

- **Feedback and Clarifications:**
  - Address the lifecycle management of the "session" as commented by a reviewer.
  - Resolve Codacy issues related to test naming by aligning with existing code style.
  - Confirm whether to use "Coherence" or "Oracle Coherence" in documentation and responses.

- **Pending Actions:**
  - Await response on potential renaming and further review to move the PR from draft to merge status.
  - Determine any additional license header requirements.
