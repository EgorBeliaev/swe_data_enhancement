## Instructions for PR #2109 Implementation

### Changes to Implement:
1. **Spotless Maven Plugin Integration**
   - Add the Spotless Maven plugin to enforce format consistency for Java code and `pom.xml` files.

2. **Consistency in Project Directory Structure**
   - Introduce `<project.root.dir>` property in multiple POM files to standardize directory structure references and reduce redundancy.

3. **Clean Up**
   - Remove duplicate settings in the `pgvector` module.

4. **Reformatting**
   - Update `pom.xml` files to adhere to specified defaults with 4-space indentation.

5. **Enhancements to Project Configuration**
   - Add linting and formatting commands to the `Makefile`.
   - Update the `CONTRIBUTING.md` with new guidelines.

### Checkpoints (To ensure quality and adherence):
1. Confirm no breaking changes have been introduced.
2. Ensure that unit and integration tests for the changes have been added and executed successfully.
3. Verify tests in core and main modules have been run and passed.
4. Document updates or additions must be in place, waiting for approval.
5. Consider adding an example to the examples repository for significant features.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure checks for adding or modifying Maven modules are complete, including updating root `pom.xml` and `langchain4j-bom/pom.xml`.
- For embedding store integrations, required integration tests should be set up for new or modified integrations.
