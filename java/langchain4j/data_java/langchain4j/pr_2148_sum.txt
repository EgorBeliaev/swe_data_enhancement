**Instruction to Programmer:**

1. **Objective**: Implement support for `anyOf` in JSON schema to enhance the structured outputs.
   
2. **Change Details**:
   - Introduce `JsonAnyOfSchema` as a new implementation of `JsonSchemaElement`.
   - This PR depends on the prior merge of [ai-for-java/openai4j#45](https://github.com/ai-for-java/openai4j/pull/45), which introduces `anyOf` support in the OpenAI client.
   - Update the version in this repository to reflect the changes from `openai4j` version `0.24.0`.

3. **Checklist**:
   - Ensure there are no breaking changes and that unit and integration tests are added.
   - Manually run all unit and integration tests, ensuring they all pass.
   - Ensure the change for handling `anyOf` is tested within AI Service level, potentially using Jackson with `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` for polymorphic serialization/deserialization.

4. **Additional Guidance**:
   - Follow the examples included in tests for implementing the solution using Jackson.
   - To handle polymorphic serialization/deserialization:
     - Create an interface and its subtypes for `anyOf`.
     - Annotate the interface accordingly.
     - Langchain4j should:
       - Identify the `@JsonSubTypes` annotations.
       - Collect possible subtypes.
       - Create `JsonSchema` for each subtype and integrate them into `JsonAnyOfSchema`.
       - Ensure deserialization functions correctly.

By implementing these changes, this PR addresses and closes the issue: [langchain4j/langchain4j#2081](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j/issues/2081).
