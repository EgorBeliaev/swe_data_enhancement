Remove Lombok in the `langchain4j` module by implementing inline `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods to improve flexibility and customization. Reformat code for readability and consistency, remove unused imports, and replace direct class loading with specific imports for clarity. Add `@EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable` condition to integration tests, utilizing the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

General Checklist:
- Ensure no breaking changes.
- Add unit and integration tests for the changes.
- Manually run all unit and integration tests in the modified module, confirming they are successful.

Note: Documentation and examples should be added after the PR is reviewed and approved.
