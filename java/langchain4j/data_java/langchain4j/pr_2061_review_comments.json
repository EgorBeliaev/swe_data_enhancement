For example: \"Closes #1234\" or \"Fixes #1234\" -->\r\nFix failing PgVector integration tests by not clearing the store in the tests\r\n\r\n## Change\r\n\r\n- Avoided redundant store clearing in tests by overriding ensureStoreIsEmpty method.\r\n- Introduced dynamic table names to avoid conflicts in concurrent testing, enhancing test reliability.\r\n- Upgraded Testcontainers dependency from 1.20.2 to 1.20.3 in the POM file.\r\n- Updated SQL string formatting to use `.formatted()` method instead of `String.format()`. This improves code readability and consistency by leveraging the streamlined formatted approach for in-place variable substitution.\r\n- Updated several test classes to use the `var` keyword for simplicity and consistency\r\n- Changed visibility modifiers and removed unnecessary public access, ensuring protected methods align with abstract class contracts. \r\n\r\n## General checklist\r\n<!-- Please double-check the following points and mark them like this: [X] -->\r\n- [x] There are no breaking changes\r\n- [ ] I have added unit and integration tests for my change\r\n- [x] I have manually run all the unit and integration tests in the module I have added/changed, and they are all green\r\n- [ ] I have manually run all the unit and integration tests in the [core](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j/tree/main/langchain4j-core) and [main](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j/tree/main/langchain4j) modules, and they are all green\r\n<!-- Before adding documentation and example(s) (below), please wait until the PR is reviewed and approved. -->\r\n- [ ] I have added/updated the [documentation](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j/tree/main/docs/docs)\r\n- [ ] I have added an example in the [examples repo](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j-examples) (only for \"big\" features)\r\n- [ ] I have added/updated [Spring Boot starter(s)](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j-spring) (if applicable)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist for adding new maven module\r\n<!-- Please double-check the following points and mark them like this: [X] -->\r\n- [ ] I have added my new module in the root `pom.xml` and `langchain4j-bom/pom.xml`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist for adding new embedding store integration\r\n<!-- Please double-check the following points and mark them like this: [X] -->\r\n- [ ] I have added a `{NameOfIntegration}EmbeddingStoreIT` that extends from either `EmbeddingStoreIT` or `EmbeddingStoreWithFilteringIT`\r\n- [ ] I have added a `{NameOfIntegration}EmbeddingStoreRemovalIT` that extends from `EmbeddingStoreWithRemovalIT`\r\n\r\n## Checklist for changing existing embedding store integration\r\n<!-- Please double-check the following points and mark them like this: [X] -->\r\n- [ ] I have manually verified that the `{NameOfIntegration}EmbeddingStore` works correctly with the data persisted using the latest released version of LangChain4j\r\n"
