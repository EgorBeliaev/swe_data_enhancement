The PR titled "classification enhancement" addresses an issue in the `EmbeddingModelTextClassifier`. When this classifier uses a "higher" `minScore`, it unnecessarily generates many `LabelWithScore` instances that are later filtered out. The proposed fix optimizes the first for-loop to prevent the creation of these unnecessary `LabelWithScore` instances, thus reducing redundant processing and unnecessary filtering.

### Instructions for the Programmer:
1. **Modification in Loop:** Adjust the logic in the first loop of the `EmbeddingModelTextClassifier` to prevent the creation of `LabelWithScore` instances when they are destined to be filtered due to a high `minScore`. This should enhance performance by reducing needless computation.
