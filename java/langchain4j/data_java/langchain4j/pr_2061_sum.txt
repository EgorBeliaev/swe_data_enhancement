**Instructions for the Programmer:**

1. **Tests Modification:**
   - Modify the PgVector integration tests by avoiding redundant store clearing. Override the `ensureStoreIsEmpty` method for this purpose.
   - Introduce dynamic table names to circumvent conflicts during concurrent testing, enhancing test reliability.

2. **Dependencies and Codebase Updates:**
   - Upgrade the Testcontainers dependency to version 1.20.3 in the POM file.
   - Refactor SQL string formatting by using the `.formatted()` method instead of `String.format()`, enhancing code readability.
   - Update several test classes to utilize the `var` keyword for cleaner and more consistent code.
   - Adjust visibility modifiers to remove unnecessary public access, ensuring that protected methods comply with abstract class contracts.

3. **General Checklist Compliance:**
   - Ensure there are no breaking changes introduced.
   - Manually run all modified unit and integration tests within the current module to ensure they pass successfully.

These tasks address the issue of failing PgVector integration tests described in the PR by refining test practices and enhancing code quality.
