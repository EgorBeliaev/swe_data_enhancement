Refactor the `onStartCommand` method in the `OblivionVpnService` class to replace multiple `if-else` statements with a `switch` statement. This change aims to improve readability and maintainability by centralizing the dispatching of Intent actions for starting and stopping the VPN service (`FLAG_VPN_START` and `FLAG_VPN_STOP`). The refactor must maintain compatibility with existing functionality and should be thoroughly tested for various Intent actions.
