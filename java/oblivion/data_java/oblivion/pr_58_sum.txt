**Instructions:**

1. **Improve Connection State Handling:**
   - Ensure the connection state is only published to registered observers when necessary.
   - Address the oversight that caused the connection state to be published to all observers whenever a new observer was registered.

2. **Refactor Activity Code:**
   - Create a base activity that observes the connection state.
   - Eliminate service binding logic duplication by centralizing this logic in the newly created base activity, which should be extended by other activities needing connection state observation.
