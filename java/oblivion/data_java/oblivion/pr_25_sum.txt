Implement a Quick Settings Connection Toggle Button feature in the Oblivion app, which allows users to connect or disconnect via the notification panel without opening the app. Major refactoring has been done on the MainActivity and OblivionVpnService classes to synchronize the notification tile button with the MainActivity button using the observer pattern through message passing. The connection state is centralized within OblivionVpnService, and interested components can register as observers. Tested on several Samsung devices with Android 11-14, but further testing on other OEMs is recommended. The toggle icon suggestion: make it identical to the app icon for user convenience.
