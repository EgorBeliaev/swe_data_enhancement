        "body": "This pull request introduces a new feature to Oblivion \u2013 Quick Settings Connection Toggle Button.\r\nQuick Settings or Tile Buttons, provide users with convenient access to easily connect or disconnect through notification panel without opening the app itself.\r\n**MainActivity and ObvilionVpnService classes were heavily refactored.** The notification tile button needed to be in sync with MainActivity button. They're now using observer pattern done through message passing. \r\nThe connection state now resides inside ObvilionVpnService and other components interested in connection status can observe it by registering an observer. This is done to have a single \"source-of-truth\" for the connection state.\r\nThe new pattern is tested on several Samsung devices running Android 11-14  and works perfectly. However this is Android's world. A feature working great on a phone might work terrible on another OEM. I think it's better to have it tested on other OEMs too.\r\n\r\n![photo_2024-02-12_06-27-48](https://github.com/bepass-org/oblivion/assets/75689502/a13a16cc-af43-4ac2-ae5a-3f1ad44058a9)\r\n![photo_2024-02-12_06-27-51](https://github.com/bepass-org/oblivion/assets/75689502/f28e897b-e76e-4126-8d95-1aff4bc905d4)\r\n"
