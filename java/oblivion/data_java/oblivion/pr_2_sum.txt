### Instructions for Implementation:

1. **Deferred Cleanup**: 
   - Implement `deferred lwip.Stop()` in conjunction with `wg.Done()` to ensure consistent cleanup operations, even when an error occurs.

2. **Log Message Optimization**:
   - Remove the unnecessary creation of a separate `logs` variable within the `GetLogMessages` function.
   - Directly join the logs for efficiency.
   - Set `logMessages` to `nil` for better memory management.

These changes aim to optimize the performance and reliability of the tun2socks operations.
