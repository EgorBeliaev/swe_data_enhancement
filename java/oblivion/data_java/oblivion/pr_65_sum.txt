The issue addressed by this PR is that the Psiphon mode in the OblivionVpnService incorrectly publishes a CONNECTED state too early, before Psiphon is actually connected, due to the local port opening before the connection is established. This PR implements a solution to wait for the Psiphon service to fully connect before publishing the CONNECTED state, thus eliminating false positives. 

Instructions for the programmer:
1. Implement a method to delay the broadcasting of the CONNECTED state until Psiphon is fully connected and internet access is verified.
2. Check the logic associated with commits after **#57**, specifically **92a9c74**, **a6a3311**, and **6e6c129**, to identify changes affecting connection state logic.
3. Ensure that all modes (Psiphon, normal, gool) behave consistently with respect to state transition and are thoroughly tested across different Android versions and real devices for any discrepancies.
4. Validate that any IP scanning related operations, especially in Psiphon mode, are working correctly and not causing unintended connectivity issues.
5. Examine the behavior regarding the built-in IP scanner, especially its effect on the randomness observed by users, and consider the impact of different network environments on Psiphon connectivity.
6. Consider the role of 'engage.cloudflare.com:2408' endpoint option and its influence on the IP scanning and connection attempt process.
