        "body": "This PR addresses several key issues and improvements within the project:\r\n\r\n1. **Fix Executor Service Stopping Issue:**\r\n   - Corrected the stopping mechanism of the Executor service to ensure that previously running threads are properly stopped and deleted, preventing the creation of multiple unnecessary threads.\r\n\r\n2. **Fix Android TV Keyboard Issue:**\r\n   - Made adjustments to the layout and input handling to address the issue where the keyboard was interrupting the edit sheet, preventing users from seeing what they were typing. Note: This fix may require further validation to confirm its effectiveness.\r\n\r\n3. **Fix Lint Issues:**\r\n   - Resolved various linting issues throughout the codebase, improving code quality and maintaining consistent coding standards.\r\n\r\n4. **Performance Improvements:**\r\n   - Implemented several optimizations to enhance the overall performance of the application.\r\n\r\n5. **Remove Unneeded Dependencies and Files:**\r\n   - Cleaned up the project by removing unnecessary dependencies and files, reducing clutter and potential security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n**Additional Notes:**\r\n- Squashed all Dependabot commits for a cleaner commit history."
