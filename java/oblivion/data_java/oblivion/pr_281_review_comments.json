        "body": "Refactor `onStartCommand` method in `OblivionVpnService` for improved action handling.\r\n\r\nThis refactor replaces multiple `if-else` statements with a `switch` statement, enhancing readability and maintainability by centralizing Intent action dispatching for starting and stopping the VPN service (`FLAG_VPN_START` and `FLAG_VPN_STOP`).\r\n\r\nKey Changes:\r\n- Simplified action handling logic using a `switch` statement.\r\n- Ensured compatibility with existing functionality.\r\n- Thoroughly tested for correct behavior with various Intent actions."
