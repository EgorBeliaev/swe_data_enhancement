Refactor the `ExpressionOptimizer` class to ensure consistency by having both optimize methods return `RowExpression`. Update the interface to document that the two methods are equivalent when using an identity function for the variable resolver, allowing shared code use. Implementations of `ExpressionOptimizer` in the SPI must update their plugins to align with the new API. Ensure compliance with the contributing guide, particularly regarding code style and commit standards. Add adequate unit tests. Update the release note to reflect changes, ensuring the correct PR number is used.
