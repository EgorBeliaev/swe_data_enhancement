### Instructions for Implementing PR Changes:

1. **Create a CPUThreadPoolExecutor for PrestoServer:**
   - Add a data member named `connectorCpuExecutor_` in `PrestoServer`.

2. **Pass CPUThreadPoolExecutor to Connectors:**
   - Ensure this executor is passed to every created Connector.

3. **Configuration Update:**
   - Introduce a new configuration, `connector.num-cpu-threads-hw-multiplier`.
   - When set to a positive value, create a process-wise CPUThreadPoolExecutor.
   - If set to other values, ensure `connectorCpuExecutor_` is `nullptr`.

4. **Objective:**
   - Facilitate the scheduling of CPU-bound asynchronous operators by Connectors, allowing them to avoid using the driver thread pool.

5. **Testing Adjustments:**
   - Be aware that existing tests may reflect unrelated framework issues; focus on the logic implemented for this change.

These changes are integral to managing CPU resources more effectively within the system by decoupling CPU-bound processes from main thread pools.
