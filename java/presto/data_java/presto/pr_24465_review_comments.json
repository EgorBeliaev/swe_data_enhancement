        "body": "## Description\r\nIn cases where a cluster needs to kill queries to stay under the configured threshold, we were using the same error code as cases where a query has more tasks than the configured threshold. This differentiates these and makes the former case an internal error.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\nIn the first case, users will see updated error messaging reflecting the internal error.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\nChanges existing tests to reflect new error codes.\r\n\r\n## Contributor checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Please make sure your submission complies with our [contributing guide](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), in particular [code style](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-style) and [commit standards](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-standards).\r\n- [ ] PR description addresses the issue accurately and concisely.
