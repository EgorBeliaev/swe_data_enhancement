**Instruction for the Change:**

- Modify the logging mechanism for connector configurations in the repository. Ensure that only connector keys are logged, not the key-value pairs. This is necessary because the values might contain sensitive information or credentials, and there is no reliable naming convention to determine the nature of keys across different storage adapters.
- Ensure that the code adheres to the contributing guide, including style and commit standards.
- Document any new properties, SQL syntax, functions, or other changes in functionality.
- Verify that adequate tests are added to check the new logging behavior.
- Confirm that no release notes are required as per the guidelines provided in the repository's documentation.

Note: The CI has not passed yet, so make sure to check and rectify any issues related to it.
