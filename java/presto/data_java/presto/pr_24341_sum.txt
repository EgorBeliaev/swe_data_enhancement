### Issue Description:
The pull request aims to optimize the `toString` method performance for certain Id classes within the repository by avoiding excessive CPU usage caused by string concatenation. It is addressing performance concerns seen in issue T212253302.

### Instructions for Changes:
1. **Optimization of `toString` Methods:**
   - Refactor the `toString` methods for specific Id classes to use `StringBuilder` instead of string concatenation.
   - Ensure that a single `StringBuilder` instance is used, particularly when creating nested Ids like `taskId`, `stageExecutionId`, and `stagesId`.

2. **Testing:**
   - Add or ensure the presence of unit tests that specifically test the newly optimized `toString` methods.
   - Verify that you have done performance testing before and after applying these changes to confirm impact.

3. **Consider Future Optimization:**
   - Evaluate the possibility of reducing unnecessary allocations by directly serializing Ids (`TaskId`, `StageExecutionId`, `StageId`) instead of converting them to `String` first.
   - Explore implementing custom serializers for these Ids similar to the existing block JSON serializer (`BlockJsonSerde.Serializer`).
   - Long-term, consider investigating binary serialization for improved scalability and performance.

4. **Contributor Checklist:**
   - Confirm that all changes comply with the projectâ€™s contributing guide, focusing on code style and commit standards.
   - Ensure that the release notes and documentation accurately describe the optimization changes applied.

5. **Release Notes Update:**
   - Update the release notes to highlight the optimizations introduced in this PR to the `toString` methods using `StringBuilder`.

### Additional Context:
- The PR discussion revealed that the Java compiler often optimizes string concatenations internally using `StringBuilder`. It is essential to ensure that these changes result in actual improvements and do not degrade performance or operation efficiency.
