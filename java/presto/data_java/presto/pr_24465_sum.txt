### Instruction for Programmer:

1. **Add a New Error Code**:
   - Implement a new error code specifically for queries killed due to exceeding the cluster's task threshold. 
   - Currently, both scenarios (when a query has more tasks than the configured threshold and when the cluster needs to kill queries to stay under the threshold) use the same error code. The new error code should separate these cases, marking the latter as an internal error.

2. **Update Error Messaging**:
   - Modify the existing error messaging system to reflect the new internal error code. This change will ensure users see the updated error messaging for queries killed due to excessive tasks in the cluster.

3. **Modify Tests**:
   - Update existing tests to incorporate the changes related to the new error codes.

4. **Contributor Checklist**:
   - Ensure that submission adheres to the projectâ€™s contributing guide, covering aspects such as code style and commit standards.
   - Validate that the PR description succinctly and accurately addresses the issue.
   - Document any new properties, SQL syntax, functions, or functionality introduced.
   - If required, prepare release notes following the guidelines provided.

5. **Note**:
   - The PR does not require a release note as indicated in the description.

By following these instructions, you will address the issue where the error code for queries was not descriptive of the specific condition leading to the query being terminated.
