        "body": "## Description\r\nCurrently, input node which is not a table scan, i.e. values node are considered as empty_connector_id, hence sub plans which have values node cannot be optimized by connector optimizer. \r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nJoin\r\n    - table scan\r\n    - values\r\n```\r\nthis sub plan is not eligible for connector optimization\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new session property, when enabled, sub plans which have values node will also be optimized by connector optimizer.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nWe have an internal connector optimizer which needs to work on the plans with both values node and table scan node.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\nEnable more flexible usage of connector optimizer. The default value of the new property is true\r\n## Test Plan\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n## Contributor checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Please make sure your submission complies with our [contributing guide](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), in particular [code style](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-style) and [commit standards](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-standards).\r\n- [ ] PR description addresses the issue accurately and concisely.
