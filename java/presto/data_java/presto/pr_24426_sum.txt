### Instructions for Repository Changes:

1. **Fix Push Error**: Address the error encountered during the push to the protected `master` branch in the Presto stable release workflow. This error is due to insufficient permissions of the GitHub action-generated token.

2. **Permission Adjustment**: Ensure the `PRESTODB_CI_TOKEN` secret is used, and confirm that the associated account is included in:
   - The "Restrict who can push to matching branches"
   - "Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests"
   - Possibly the bypass rule list.

3. **Testing**: Validate the workflow by testing it in the repository mentioned (`https://github.com/unix280/presto`) to confirm the fix.

4. **Action Execution Restrictions**:
   - Amend the action configuration to ensure only the `prestodb-ci` actor can trigger this workflow.
   - Ensure the action is restricted to run solely on the `master` branch.

5. **Checklist Compliance**: Verify all contribution checklists, especially code style and commit standards, are adhered to.

Note: According to the PR, no release note is necessary for this change.
