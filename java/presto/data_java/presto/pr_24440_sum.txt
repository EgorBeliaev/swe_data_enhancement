The following instructions are based on the provided PR discussion for a change in the repository:

**Issue to Fix:**
The repository encounters an error when attempting to batch read nested decimal columns (enabled with `hive.parquet-batch-read-optimization-enabled=true`) using Parquet format. Specifically, this occurs for nested decimal columns represented as an array of integers (e.g., OPTIONAL INT32 L:DECIMAL(1,0)), resulting in an `UnsupportedOperationException`.

**Changes to Implement:**
- Avoid the use of batch reading for nested decimals, as it is not supported in the current reader implementation, to prevent the `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException`.
- Ensure that the feature is disabled, or handle this scenario gracefully within the Hive Connector to avoid this error.

**Tests:**
Add the following tests to confirm the fix:
- `testNestedArraysDecimalBackedByINT32`
- `testNestedArraysDecimalBackedByINT64`
- `testNestedArraysShortDecimalBackedByBinary`

These tests should ensure that without the PR changes, attempts to read such nested decimals fail, confirming the issue.

This change addresses issue #23877 and ensures stability when reading nested decimals with the Hive Connector.
