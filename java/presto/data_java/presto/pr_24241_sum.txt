### Instructions for the Programmer:

1. **Refactor Methods:**
   - Refactor `Duration::toString` and `DataSize::toString` methods to use `fmt::format` instead of `snprintf`.

2. **Code Quality:**
   - Ensure that the code aligns with modern C++ practices, improving safety, readability, and maintainability.

3. **Commit Standards:**
   - Merge your commits and use the same commit message as the PR title: "[native] Refactor Duration::toString and DataSize::toString to use fmt::format."

4. **Formatting:**
   - Address format-check errors by running `make format-fix` in the `presto-cpp` folder and commit any changes suggested. Check formatting compliance at: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/prestodb/presto/23646/workflows/08edfa15-4ce4-44cb-8cca-003495536fd6/jobs/98777.

5. **References:**
   - Follow the [contributing guide](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for code style and commit standards.
