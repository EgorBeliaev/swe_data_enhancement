Title: Record CPU time on various planning stages

Description: Implement recording of additional runtime metrics to analyze sources of planning latency. This involves attributing latency to RPC activity versus on-CPU activity during different planning stages.

- Motivation: The implementation aims to precisely determine latency causes by tracking CPU time.

- Impact: No anticipated impact specified.

- Test Plan: Ensure successful continuous integration (CI) as a validation step.
