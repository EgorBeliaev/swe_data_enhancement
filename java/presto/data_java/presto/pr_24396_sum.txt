Title: `[native] Fix varchar cast for json`

**Issue Addressed:**
This PR resolves an error when casting JSON as a varchar with a capped length in Prestissimo, leading to an issue with the `substr` function not registered with the argument types `(JSON, BIGINT, BIGINT)`.

**Primary Changes to Implement:**
1. Implement fix to address the failure of casting JSON to varchar with capped length leading to the specified error in Prestissimo.
2. Ensure that an exception is raised for `try_cast()` behavior as its alignment is not within the scope of this PR.
3. Add a unit test to validate the fix.

**Additional Requests:**
1. Update the commit message and PR title to follow the format: `[native] Fix varchar cast for JSON`.
2. Ensure that all relevant sections of the PR template are filled out correctly as per guidelines, particularly including any necessary release notes.
3. Delegate adding an end-to-end (e2e) test for this functionality. Locate an appropriate place within the context of `presto-native-execution` changes for these tests.
