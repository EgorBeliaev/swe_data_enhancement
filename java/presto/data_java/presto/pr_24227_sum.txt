### Instruction to Implementing Programmer

1. **Objective**: Modify the connector optimizer to include optimization for plans with 'Values' nodes.
   
2. **Change**:
   - Introduce a new session property: `include_values_node_in_connector_optimizer`.
   - Ensure this property is enabled by default.

3. **Rationale**:
   - Currently, plans with 'Values' nodes are not optimized by the connector optimizer, limiting optimization capability for certain query plans (e.g., with both table scan and values node).

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - Adjust the logic so that the optimizer recognizes and optimizes sub-plans containing 'Values' nodes.
   - Set the default state of `include_values_node_in_connector_optimizer` to `true` to allow optimization by default.

5. **Testing**:
   - Validate using existing test cases to ensure that optimizations are correctly applied when the property is enabled.
  
6. **Documentation**:
   - Document the new session property, including its default value and effect on query plan optimization.

7. **Release Notes**:
   - Update release notes to include this new session property and its significance, ensuring proper referencing (`:pr:12345`).

This instruction will guide you through making the relevant changes to ensure 'Values' nodes are optimized within your session's connector optimizer.
