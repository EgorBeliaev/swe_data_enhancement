The problem is that the key-value pairs likely contain secrets that should not be logged as this leaks credentials.\r\n\r\ninstead, only the configured keys are printed without the value because we cannot determine what are keys reliably because there is not a reliable naming convention across the storage adapters.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!---Describe your changes in detail-->\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n<!---Why is this change required?
