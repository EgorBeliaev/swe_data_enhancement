        "body": "## Description\r\nRefactor `ExpressionOptimizer` to consistently return `RowExpression`.  Before, `ExpressionOptimizer` would return `RowExpression` only for the method which did not take in a variable resolver function.  I cannot discern a good reason for this.  By refactoring this interface and making them both return `RowExpression`, and documenting that the two methods are equivalent when an identity function is used for the variable resolver, it becomes possible to share code that uses both methods.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nThis is to help address PR review feedback here: https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/24144#discussion_r1890678899\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\nCode refactoring.  Implementations of `ExpressionOptimizer` in the SPI will need to update their plugins to accommodate the changed API.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n## Contributor checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Please make sure your submission complies with our [contributing guide](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), in particular [code style](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-style) and [commit standards](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-standards).\r\n- [ ] PR description addresses the issue accurately and concisely.  If the change is non-trivial, a GitHub Issue is referenced.\r\n- [ ] Documented new properties (with its default value), SQL syntax, functions, or other functionality.\r\n- [ ] If release notes are required, they follow the [release notes guidelines](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/wiki/Release-Notes-Guidelines).\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable.\r\n- [ ] CI passed.\r\n\r\n## Release Notes\r\nPlease follow [release notes guidelines](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/wiki/Release-Notes-Guidelines) and fill in the release notes below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n== RELEASE NOTES ==\r\n\r\nSPI Changes\r\n* Improve ExpressionOptimizer#optimize method with a variable resolver to return ``RowExpression``. :pr:`24287`\r\n```\r\n\r\n"
