**Instructions for Programmer:**

1. **Implementation**:
   - Update the `QueryResult` component to support the BigInt data type.
   - Ensure that the component uses the `toString()` function for outputting BigInt values.

2. **Testing**:
   - Test the `QueryResult` component's display of BigInt data type on a supported browser (Chrome).
   - Verify that the BigInt data type does not break functionalities on unsupported browsers (such as Firefox).

3. **Documentation**:
   - Follow the Presto projectâ€™s contributing guidelines for code style and commit message standards.
   - Ensure that the release notes reflect addition of BigInt support in the SQL Client on Presto UI, including links to compatibility details.

4. **Release Notes**:
   - Add an entry in the release notes under "General Changes" indicating support for the BigInt data type now available in supported browsers. Reference the PR number in the release notes entry.

**Issue Description**:
- This PR aims to fix an issue in the Presto project where the `QueryResult` component could not correctly display BigInt data types. Without this change, users encountering BigInt values may not have accurate representations or may face precision issues, especially in unsupported browsers like Firefox, which might not handle BigInt data correctly.
