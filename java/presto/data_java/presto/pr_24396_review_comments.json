It occurs when attempting to cast JSON as varchar of capped length.\r\nNote: Exception is still raised for try_cast() behavior. Alignment is out of scope for this PR\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n- [x] Added unit test\r\n\r\n## Contributor checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Please make sure your submission complies with our [contributing guide](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), in particular [code style](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-style) and [commit standards](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-standards).\r\n- [x] PR description addresses the issue accurately and concisely.
