**Instruction to Programmer:**

1. **Add Base Module:** Implement the Arrow Flight base module as a template for connectors that use a Flight service to transfer data with Presto in Arrow format.
   
2. **Extend Base Client Handler:** Develop a concrete Arrow Flight connector implementation by extending the `BaseArrowFlightClientHandler`. This handler should be capable of connecting to a Flight service and handling necessary RPC calls.

3. **Testing and Query Runner:** Incorporate unit tests specific to the Arrow Flight connector implementation. Extend `com.facebook.presto.tests.AbstractTestQueries` to test general queries over Flight. Implement additional round-trip testing for all data types supported by the `ArrowBlockBuilder`. Provide an `ArrowFlightQueryRunner` for standalone manual query testing.

4. **Documentation Update:** Ensure new properties, SQL syntax, functions, or other new functionalities are documented. Validate the alignment of the documentation with proposed changes to the code.
   
5. **Release Note Adjustments:**
   - Confirm the correct PR number in the release notes.
   - Under general changes, note the addition of the Arrow Flight connector and the respective documentation: 
     - Add Arrow Flight connector :pr:`24427`
     - Add documentation for the :doc:`/connector/base-arrow-flight` :pr:`24427`
   
6. **Fix Compatibility Issue:** Resolve compatibility issues with `ArrowFileWriter` when running Java 8. Transition to using `ArrowStreamWriter` for serialization in tests.

7. **CI and Standards Compliance:** Verify that the CI checks pass and ensure compliance with the contributing guide regarding code style and commit standards. Check if release notes adhere to the guidelines.

These instructions include objectives to implement new functionality, test rigorously, update documentation, and ensure compatibility and standard compliance for the Arrow Flight connector template in the repository.
