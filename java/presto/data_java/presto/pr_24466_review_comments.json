        "body": "On certain databases (e.g. Derby, Oracle) it uses ````CLOB```` and these databases disallow ````=```` predicates over ````CLOB```` values. At the same time, they allow ````LIKE```` predicates over them.\r\n\r\ncherry-picked : https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/833\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nAdded a new private method getPrestoViews(String databaseName):\r\n\r\n1. Uses get_table_names_by_filter to fetch tables marked as Presto views.\r\n2. Introduced fallback logic:\r\na. First attempts = predicate on PRESTO_VIEW_FLAG.\r\nb. If it fails, attempts LIKE predicate.\r\nc. Stores successful attempts in metastoreKnownToSupportTableParamEqualsPredicate and metastoreKnownToSupportTableParamLikePredicate.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n\r\n```Hive 2.3 metastore``` provides more space for table parameter values. On certain databases (e.g. Derby, Oracle) it uses ```CLOB``` and these databases disallow ```=``` predicates over ```CLOB values```. At the same time, they allow ```LIKE``` predicates over them.\r\n\r\nThis fixes ```SHOW TABLES``` and queries over information_schema.tables.\r\n\r\nAlso, fixes https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/10735, https://github.com/nico-arianto/big-data-local/issues/1.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nClob datatype issue resolved.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nchecked using presto-cli. \r\n\r\n## Contributor checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Please make sure your submission complies with our [contributing guide](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), in particular [code style](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-style) and [commit standards](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-standards).\r\n- [ ] PR description addresses the issue accurately and concisely.
