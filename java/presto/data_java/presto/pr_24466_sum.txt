**Instruction for Implementation:**

1. Fix the `SHOW TABLES` implementation for Hive metastore 2.3+ by creating a new private method `getPrestoViews(String databaseName)` which:
   - Uses `get_table_names_by_filter` to fetch tables marked as Presto views.
   - Introduces fallback logic:
     - First, attempt an `=` predicate on `PRESTO_VIEW_FLAG`.
     - If it fails, attempt a `LIKE` predicate.
     - Store successful attempts in `metastoreKnownToSupportTableParamEqualsPredicate` and `metastoreKnownToSupportTableParamLikePredicate`.

2. Resolve the issue with CLOB datatype, specifically with `=` predicates not being supported by databases like Derby and Oracle, allowing only `LIKE` predicates instead.

3. Test using presto-cli to ensure the fix is effective.

4. Update commit description to remove any unintended line breaks, ensuring correct formatting.

5. Follow the latest release note guidelines:
   - Avoid manually adding PR links in the release notes, as they are now automatically appended.

6. Ensure all changes are compliant with the existing [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This PR addresses and fixes existing issues in the repository, notably https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/10735 and https://github.com/nico-arianto/big-data-local/issues/1, improving functionality and addressing datatype handling within metastore queries.
