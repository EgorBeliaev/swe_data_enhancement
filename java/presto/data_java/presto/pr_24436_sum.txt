**Instruction Summary:**

- Update the secure connection protocol to use `TLS 1.2` instead of older SSL protocols like `SSLv2` and `SSLv3`, which are vulnerable.
- Modify instances of `SSLContext` initialization to ensure they automatically select the best-supported version of `TLS`.
- Note for backward compatibility: Connection may fail if the client does not support `TLS 1.2`.
- Ensure the code conforms to the contributing guidelines and code style.
- If applicable, add adequate tests for new changes.
- Follow and update release notes based on the provided guidelines.

**Issue Addressed:**

The PR addresses the usage of weak SSL/TLS protocols identified by SonarQube rule `java:S4423`, enhancing security by mitigating vulnerabilities such as POODLE through the adoption of the more secure `TLS 1.2` protocol.
