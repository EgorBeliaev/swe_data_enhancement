### Instruction for Programmer:
Update the "Presto Session Properties" documentation by adding a new section titled "JDBC Properties." This will include the previously undocumented JdbcMetadataConfig properties, addressing GitHub issue #23918. Ensure compliance with the contributing guide and verify that all new properties, along with their default values, are documented. Confirm that CI passes and that release notes are updated according to guidelines if necessary.
