**Instruction for Programmer:**

Enable the Github action workflow to run the `linux-build-and-unit-test` on the master branch after a PR merge, similar to how CircleCI operates. Ensure caching of master branch build artifacts for improved build times on PR initiation by utilizing the master branch cache. Verify compliance with the project's contributing guide and include the new workflow implementation details if necessary. Ensure no release notes are required for this change.
