**Instruction for Programmer:**

- Remove flaky Spark tests currently causing instability in the CI pipeline as these tests are unreliable. 
- An identified class contributing to the flakiness has an open issue for tracking: [Issue #24404](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/24404).
- The goal is to run as many stable tests as possible by excluding these known flaky tests temporarily until they can be addressed.
