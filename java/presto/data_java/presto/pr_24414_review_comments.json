        "body": "## Description\r\n1. Thanks to @arhimondr who observed that GC could take too much cpu to clean up memory during heavy load\r\n<img width=\"1401\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 21 55 30\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/878540d7-d5f3-435c-80d1-b8172b137e84\" />\r\n\r\n2. This pr will be the first of a series of optimization to improve how objects are being created along the critical path.\r\n3. This pr optimizes how we merge multiple operatorStats without creating temporary/intermediate objects\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n1. The original code will create temporary objects every time we add two OperatorStats together (with same id) using v.add(operatorStats) and this intermediate object will be discarded when it is used to merge with next OperatorStats object, This PR groups all operatorStats by their id and then merge them together in one go.\r\n2. Refactoring the code by moving local variables into a dedicated class so that we can easily use one loop within the _create_ method to aggregate all necessary metrics.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n<!---Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact-->\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n1. local hiveQueryRunner works fine\r\n2. Internal verifier tests passed\r\n\r\n## Contributor checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Please make sure your submission complies with our [contributing guide](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), in particular [code style](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-style) and [commit standards](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-standards).\r\n- [ ] PR description addresses the issue accurately and concisely.
