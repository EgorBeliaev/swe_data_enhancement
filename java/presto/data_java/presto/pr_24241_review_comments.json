        "body": "## Description\r\nRefactored the Duration::toString and DataSize::toString methods to replace the use of snprintf with fmt::format. This change modernizes the codebase, eliminates the need for manual buffer management, and ensures safer and more readable formatting operations.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\nRefactored to align with modern C++ practices, improving safety, readability, and maintainability. fmt::format eliminates manual buffer management and the risks of buffer overflows inherent in snprintf.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\nSimplifies the code, reduces error-prone logic, and aligns with modern C++ standards. The output remains consistent with the original implementation, with minimal performance impact and improved maintainability.\r\n\r\n## Contributor checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Please make sure your submission complies with our [contributing guide](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), in particular [code style](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-style) and [commit standards](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-standards).\r\n- [ ] PR description addresses the issue accurately and concisely.  If the change is non-trivial, a GitHub Issue is referenced.\r\n- [ ] Documented new properties (with its default value), SQL syntax, functions, or other functionality.\r\n- [ ] If release notes are required, they follow the [release notes guidelines](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/wiki/Release-Notes-Guidelines).\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable.\r\n- [ ] CI passed.\r\n"
