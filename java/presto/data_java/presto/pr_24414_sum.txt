Optimize the merging process of `operatorStats` by:

1. Grouping `operatorStats` by their ID and merging them together in one go, instead of creating temporary objects with each addition.
2. Refactoring by moving local variables into a dedicated class to allow for efficient aggregation of metrics within a single loop in the `_create_` method. 

Ensure these changes are compliant with the code style guidelines and contributing standards.
