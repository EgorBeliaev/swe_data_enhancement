**Instruction:**

- Break the existing Media category tab into two separate tabs: one for videos and one for images.
- Maintain functionality for selecting only videos, audio, or images in their respective tabs ensuring users can easily choose between them for improved usability in different scenarios, such as when audio or visual access might be restricted.
