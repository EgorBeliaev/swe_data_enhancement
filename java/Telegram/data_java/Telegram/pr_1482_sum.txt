**Issue Description:**

The PR addresses a bug in the rendering of vcards for selected inline query results in a chat application. When selecting a contact that includes a vcard using a bot, the vcard does not render immediately in the chat. The correct rendering appears only after switching between chats and returning. 

**Expected Behavior:** 
The vcard should render immediately when the contact is sent into the chat.

**Resolution in PR:**
The PR fixes the issue by ensuring that any vcard contained within a selected inline query result is correctly passed down for immediate rendering.
