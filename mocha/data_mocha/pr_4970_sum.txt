**Instructions for Updating the Repository Package:**

1. **Update Glob Dependency:**
   - Change the `glob` package version from `7.2.0` to `8.1.0` to resolve a security vulnerability related to the `minimatch` package (previous versions <= `3.0.4` are insecure).

2. **Address Module Not Found Error:**
   - Update tests that reference `coffee-script` to `coffeescript` (without hyphen) because the hyphenated package is deprecated.

3. **Add Missing ESLint Plugin:**
   - Initially, the package `eslint-plugin-n` is added to resolve a linting error. Note that recent NPM versions handle peer dependencies differently, so verify if `eslint-plugin-n` is still needed in the main `package.json`.

4. **General Cleanup:**
   - Ensure `package-lock.json` is accurately reflecting these changes and is trustworthy for CI/CD processes.

**Issue Being Addressed:**

This PR addresses a high-security risk found in the `minimatch` dependency of the `glob` package used by `mocha`, upgrading the dependency to mitigate the vulnerability. Adjustments to test scripts and linting configurations are also included to maintain the integrity and functionality of the build process.
