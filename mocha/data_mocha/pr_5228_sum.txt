**Instructions for Updating the HTML Reporter Test Links:**

1. **Fix Link Generation for Suites and Tests**:
   - Modify suite link generation by adding '^' at the start and ' ' (space) at the end to ensure links for suites such as `Case1` do not incorrectly target `Case10 test1`.
   - Adjust test link generation by adding '^' at the start and '$' at the end to ensure links for tests like `CSS` do not incorrectly target `should fix invalid CSS`.

2. **Note on Testing**:
   - No automated tests need to be added for this change, as the HTML reporter currently does not have related tests.
   - Although the commit history shows prior reporter changes without tests, manual testing or headless-browser testing infrastructure can be considered for future implementations if desired.

**Issue Being Fixed**:
This PR addresses and resolves inaccurate test link targets within the HTML reporter, preventing links from mistakenly hitting unintended suites or tests.
