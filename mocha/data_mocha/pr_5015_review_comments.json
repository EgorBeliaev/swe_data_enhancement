        "body": "### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nIt's possible for HTMLCanvasElement to not be available. In the HTML reporter, if canvas isn't available, there's no fallback to see the progress percentage.\r\n\r\nhere's a picture:\r\n![image](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/assets/16181109/c9e32b18-43f1-4420-8e70-2fc17eaaa1a5)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nUsing CSS flex-basis to create a progress bar, this is good alternative and can also work. However, to ensure compatibility, I decided to use text as the fallback because I know it'll work.\r\n\r\n### Why should this be in core?\r\n\r\nSeems to be a bug that makes it very hard to see the progress of test.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThe progress can be seen regardless if canvas is available\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nVery niche, 99% of cases, canvas is supported\r\n\r\n### Applicable issues\r\n\r\nFixes #5113."
