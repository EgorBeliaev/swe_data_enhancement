**Instruction to Programmer:**

- Refactor the codebase by replacing the two instances of the `fs-extra` library with newer `fs` built-in functions.
- Ensure that the refactoring aligns with the implementation in `fs-extra@10.1.0` as noted in the project's lockfile.
- This change addresses issue #5266 and is ready for merge once CI tests are successfully completed.
