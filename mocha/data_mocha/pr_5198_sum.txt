### Instruction for Implementation:
1. **Objective**: Handle the corner case when `mocha` configuration in `package.json` has invalid JSON due to a stray comma, and `mocha` is run directly instead of via `npm test`.
   
2. **Changes Required**:
   - Ensure that an invalid `package.json` configuration does not cause the application to crash when `mocha` is executed directly.
   - Update any specific assertions that might break due to the presence of obviously invalid JSON.

3. **Outstanding Tasks**:
   - Incorporate the feedback given (details not specified in the JSON).
   - Fix the too-specific assertion in tests to handle invalid JSON cases appropriately.

### Context of PR:
- **Related Issue**: Fixes #5141, dealing with scenarios where users may inadvertently leave a stray comma in `package.json`.
- **Review Notes**: The solution strategy for this PR was agreed upon, with particular note of improvements to the GitHub task list formatting in the description by removing spaces within checkboxes.

This PR ensures robustness in handling cases involving JSON errors in project configurations, specifically targeting scenarios that involve running `mocha` directly.
