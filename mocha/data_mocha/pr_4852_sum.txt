Replace all instances of `String.prototype.substr()` with `String.prototype.slice()` as `substr()` is deprecated. This change ensures the code does not rely on deprecated functions, with no identified drawbacks. An alternative of using `substring()` was considered but `slice()` was chosen. Coverage remains the same post-change.
