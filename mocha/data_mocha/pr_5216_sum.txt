This pull request updates the Mocha project's engine version range to align with modern dependencies, focusing on ESLint 9's version range of `^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0`. It aims to facilitate updates by incorporating the `installed-check` tool to validate dependency engine ranges. It addresses issue #5206 by preparing the project for Mocha 11, ensuring compatibility with dependencies, while maintaining support for Node 20, and setting up `release-please` for pre-releases. Decisions around bumping Node versions to 16 or 18 remain under discussion, with a recommendation to move to 18 for simplification and forward compatibility.
