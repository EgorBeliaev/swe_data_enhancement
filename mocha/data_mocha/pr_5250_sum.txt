This GitHub Pull Request updates the `glob` dependency in the `package.json` from version 8 to 10 for the Mocha framework. Maintain an alphabetical `'en'` sort with `glob.sync` results to ensure consistency in the order of test file execution. Avoid upgrading to `glob@11` since Mocha 11 still supports Node.js 18, and `glob@11` requires Node.js 20 or higher. This update addresses issue #5148. 

Note: Internal dependencies in the repository still require updates, which is tracked in issue #5207.
