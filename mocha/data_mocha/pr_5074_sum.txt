The pull request addresses an error handling issue in `lib/cli/run.js` by improving the report when a TypeScript error occurs, which previously resulted in the misleading output "ERROR: null". The revised error message provides detailed feedback about the TypeScript error encountered.

### Instructions:
1. Enhance error handling to correctly capture and display TypeScript errors in `lib/cli/run.js`.
2. Update error outputs to provide a clearer and more informative message, such as including the exact nature and location of the TypeScript error, rather than outputting "ERROR: null".
3. Consider simplifying the error handling using `console.error('\n Mocha run failed:', err);` to improve maintainability and comprehensiveness.
4. Ensure the error handling supports standard JavaScript `AggregateError` objects and the Error `cause` attributes in future iterations.
5. Test thoroughly to ensure the new error messages are correctly displayed without causing test failures.
6. If applicable, include tests or a reproduction scenario to validate the changes. A reproduction project has been provided [here](https://github.com/stalet/mocha-typescript-testproject).

### Issue Description:
Before this patch, the error handling failed to capture the full context of a TypeScript error, resulting in a vague output. Debugging revealed the error: "TypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value", hindering developers' ability to diagnose the actual error. This patch resolves that by providing a complete error message.
