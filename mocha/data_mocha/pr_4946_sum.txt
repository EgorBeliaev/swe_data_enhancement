**Instruction to Programmer:**

Correct the color of the failed test icon (`âœ–`) in the CSS selector `#mocha .test.fail::before`. Change the color from `#00d6b2` to `#cc0000` for the light schema and `#ff4444` for the dark schema. This change fixes an incorrect variable reference causing the icon to display the wrong color, which has been an issue since it was noted in a previous PR (https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/4896).
