The Pull Request (PR) introduces the functionality to decorate ESM module names before importing them by passing an `esmDecorator` function to the `loadFilesAsync` method. This allows for bypassing ESM caching issues using query parameters in module names, which is beneficial for anyone facing caching problems with ESM modules while using Mocha via its API. 

### Instructions for Changes:
1. Implement the feature to accept an `esmDecorator` function in the `loadFilesAsync` method to modify ESM module names before loading.
2. Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality. 
3. Confirm that the sub-dependencies of test files are not reloaded as a known limitation. This should be clearly documented.
4. Respond to review feedback and make any minor code changes as requested.
5. Add appropriate tests to validate this new feature and ensure it works as expected.
6. Consider the behavior and interaction with Mocha's CLI `--require` option, although they serve different use cases and are confirmed to not conflict.
7. Await confirmation from affected users, such as those who previously faced issues with the current system, indicating this solves their problem.

### Issue Description:
This PR addresses problems related to ESM module caching within Mocha's API environment. It resolves specific GitHub issues (#4924 and #4655) by implementing a method to modify module URLs at import time, preventing unwanted caching.
