**Instruction for Changes:**

- Increase the contrast for replay buttons in both light and dark mode as demonstrated in the attached screenshots.
- Ensure the arrow buttons are updated to correct colors (black `#000`, not white `#fff`).
- Rebase the branch on the latest master to resolve any conflicts due to recent additions for dark color scheme support.

**Issue Being Fixed:**

- The current replay buttons lack sufficient visual emphasis, making them less visible for users. This PR addresses and fixes visibility issues as referenced in issue #4911.
