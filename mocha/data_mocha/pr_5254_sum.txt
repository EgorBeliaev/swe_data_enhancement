**Instruction for Repository Changes:**

1. **Fix for `Error.stackTraceLimit`:**
   - Catch exceptions when attempting to set `Error.stackTraceLimit` under `--frozen-intrinsics` mode.
   - Log the caught `TypeError` for debugging purposes and allow the application to continue running.

2. **Testing Considerations:**
   - Note that tests involving `unexpected` module cannot run with `--frozen-intrinsics` due to a `TypeError` from `unexpected-bluebird`.
   - Current test setup involves `test/setup.js` requiring `unexpected`, causing most tests to fail with `--frozen-intrinsics`.
   - Proposal to either:
     - Smoke test using `node --frozen-intrinsics bin/mocha.js --version`.
     - Consider configuring an alternate test setup without `unexpected` for a thorough test.
   - Suggest waiting for `unexpected` to support `--frozen-intrinsics` before full integration into testing if the effort does not justify the immediate changes.

3. **Release Strategy:**
   - Treat this as a bugfix requiring a patch-level version bump.
   - Plan integration post-release of Mocha 11, ensuring proper version management.
   - Monitor for any issues before proceeding with merging the changes.

**Repository Issue Being Fixed:**

The problem addressed is the inability to set `Error.stackTraceLimit` in environments where Node.js is run with `--frozen-intrinsics`. This causes uncaught exceptions and exits the application. The fix aims to handle and log these exceptions gracefully to minimize disruption during execution.
