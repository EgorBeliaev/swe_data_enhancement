The issue being addressed in this pull request is that when padding an image, the dimensions were incorrectly stretched, causing the right and bottom parts of the image to get cropped. The problem arose because the image was being drawn with a new width (`newWidth`) that encompassed the entire width including padding, which it shouldn't have. The fix involves drawing the image without altering its original width and height, ensuring the padding is applied correctly on all sides without stretching or cropping. The correct implementation uses `sWidth` and `sHeight` to match `dWidth` and `dHeight`, based on the information from the CanvasRenderingContext2D documentation.
