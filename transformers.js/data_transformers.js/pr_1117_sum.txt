Add support for visualizing per-layer, per-head self-attention heatmaps in sequence classifier models with attentions. Utilize the ONNX model "dinov2-with-registers-small-with-attentions." Implement example usage as provided in the PR, which includes loading the model and processor, reading and processing images, and performing inference to obtain logits and attention maps. Visualize the attention maps by upscaling and saving them as images for the last layer. Ensure configurability for the number of attention heads and tokens. Documentation updates can be found at the specified Hugging Face Docs Builder endpoint, available for 30 days after the last update.
