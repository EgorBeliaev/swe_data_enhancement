**Changes to be made:**

1. **Add Functionality:**
   - Implement a function to apply a mask to a `RawImage`.
   - This functionality will replace the alpha channel of the image with the mask values.

2. **Example Usage:**
   - Load and prepare a `RawImage` with padding.
   - Process the image using a model to obtain the mask.
   - Resize and crop the mask to match the image dimensions.
   - Apply the mask to the image and save the result.

3. **Enhancements:**
   - Update the function to support both 3-channel and 4-channel images.

4. **Naming:**
   - Consider renaming the `applyMask` function to `putalpha` based on reference material for better clarity and relevance.

5. **Follow-up:**
   - Plan to add unit tests in a follow-up PR due to current permission limitations.

**References:**
- Look into similar mask application functionalities, such as those in Python's PIL library.
- Refer to: https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pillow-putalpha/ for detailed understanding and potential alignment with the `putalpha` naming.

No additional feedback or issues to address beyond the implementation and naming suggestions outlined.
