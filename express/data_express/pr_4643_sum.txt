**Instructions:**

1. **Objective**: Update the `hbs` package to fix vulnerabilities identified by `npm audit` in the development dependencies. This update does not affect the main application but is crucial for maintaining CI integrity.
   
2. **Scope**:
   - Focus solely on the `hbs` package update as per the latest agreement.
   - Note that `Redis-connect` is not included in this update based on the latest comment by the author.

3. **Rationale**:
   - The vulnerabilities are present only in the `devDependencies`, which means they do not impact the production readiness of the main application (`express`).

Ensure all relevant tests are rerun after making these updates to verify that the CI/CD pipeline remains unaffected.
