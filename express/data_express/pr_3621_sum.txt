### Instruction for Change:

1. **Default Query Parser Change**: Update the default setting of the query parser from "extended" to "simple". This change will be included directly in the 5.0 branch.

2. **Deprecation Consideration**: Although there was discussion regarding adding a deprecation warning in 4.x, the decision is not to include this due to potential churn and the timing of the 5.0 release.

3. **Query Middleware Update**: Ensure that the behavior aligns with how `express.urlencoded` handles deprecation for the `extended` option, particularly when detecting the use of an extended object without an explicit `app.set('query parser', 'extended')`.

4. **Immediate Release Strategy**: Since the change is to be included in the 5.0 release, integrate it into the 5.0 branch as soon as possible. This will allow testing through alpha releases on npm to monitor any possible issues.

Note: Ensure to verify compatibility and potential impacts on existing applications using the soon-to-be-released version.
