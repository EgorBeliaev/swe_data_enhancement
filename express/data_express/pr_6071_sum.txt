Replace usage of `safe-buffer` with `node:buffer` in the codebase, as Node.js 18 supports this change. Ensure there is no `new Buffer` usage in the repository. Adjust the commit type to either `fix` or `feat`, and note that the "scope" section is optional for this particular commit, though this is not strictly enforced.
