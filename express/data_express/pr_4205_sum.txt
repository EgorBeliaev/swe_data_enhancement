**Issue Summary:**

This Pull Request originally aimed to modify the `trim_prefix` logic in the router that mishandled regular expression path matches not anchored at the start. The incorrect behavior was identified by the following scenario:

- **Problem**: When a regular expression matches a path starting from a non-zero index, the `trim_prefix` incorrectly validated if the path should break on a path separator. 

**Original Solution:**
- Proposed to test the matched `layerPath` starting from the match's start index for correct trimming.

**Feedback and Revision:**
- The feedback highlighted that `app.use` should match based purely on prefix, not as proposed. 
- Suggestion was made to prepend `^` to the regular expression if not specified by the user, ensuring matches at the start of the path as intended behavior.

**Resolution:**
- The change was reverted.
- A unit test was added to showcase the initial problem without directly altering the functionality.

**Final Fix by Maintainers:**
- An upstream fix was committed to resolve the issue while retaining prefix matching convention.
- The fix was confirmed to address the problem identified and passes the newly added test.

**Current Action:**
- The fixed logic from the upstream `router` repository has been ported to this PR.
- It will be merged into the upcoming `4.x` library release.

**Instruction:**
- **No code changes needed** from the contributor's end as the updated fix has been incorporated into this PR.
  
Please note that code behavioral/performance impacts are preserved to maintain correctness, while ensuring that existing prefix matching logic is not unintentionally altered.
