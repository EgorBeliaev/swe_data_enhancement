The PR proposes several changes to optimize CI runs and reduce duplication:

1. **Limit CI Runs on Push Events**:  
   - Configure CI to only run on push events for the following branches: `master`, `develop`, `4.x`, `5.x`.
   
2. **Skip CI for Markdown Changes**:  
   - Implement a rule to skip CI runs when the only changes made are to `.md` files, as markdown files are currently not linted.
   
3. **Manage Workflow Concurrency**:  
   - Use GitHub Actions' concurrency feature to ensure only the latest workflow run for a specific PR or branch head executes, effectively canceling any previous runs triggered by new updates to the same branch or PR. 

These steps aim to conserve CI resources and streamline workflows by reducing unnecessary duplicate checks.
