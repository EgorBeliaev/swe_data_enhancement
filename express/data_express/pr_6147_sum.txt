**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Removal Task**: Remove the check for `AsyncLocalStorage` support. This is now unnecessary as the minimum supported Node version is v18, and `AsyncLocalStorage` was introduced in Node versions v13.10.0 and v12.17.0.

2. **Documentation Update**: Ensure to manually update the `HISTORY.md` file to reflect this code change, as automation for updating this file is not currently in place.

**Context Note**: The discussion confirms the removal of outdated checks due to updated Node version compatibility and emphasizes the need for manual documentation updates until an automated process is established.
