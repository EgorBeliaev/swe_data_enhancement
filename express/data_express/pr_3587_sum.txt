**Instructions to Programmer:**

1. Modify `res.format` to call the `default` handler using the format object (`obj`) as the context (`this`).
2. Ensure consistency by setting the `this` context for all handlers (both default and non-default) to the format object.
3. Update the invocation to `fn.call(formatObj, req, res, next, formatObj)` to pass the format object as both `this` and an argument.
4. Implement a test case to validate that the `default` handler now operates with the same context as other handlers.

**Issue Addressed:**

The PR addresses the inconsistency where the `default` handler in `res.format` was unable to reference other handlers via `this`, unlike non-default handlers. This inconsistency complicated handler declarations and increased code complexity. By aligning the `this` context for default and non-default handlers, the PR simplifies delegation and improves code uniformity.
