### Instruction for Repository Changes:

1. **Deprecation of Non-Integer Status Codes**:
   - Implement deprecation warnings in version 4 for non-integer status codes to prepare for breaking changes in version 5.
   - Focus specifically on string values like `'200'` and `'304.5'` and non-integer values like `200.5`, which are currently accepted under Node.js but will throw errors in version 5.

2. **Use `res.status` for Status Code Assignments**:
   - Replace occurrences of `this.statusCode = N` with `res.status` within the codebase. Note that this change must be cautiously applied to avoid breaking changes.

3. **Deprecation Messaging**:
   - Ensure deprecation messages are only printed for behaviors transitioning from non-throwing in version 4 to throwing in version 5 to avoid redundant warnings.

4. **Check for Deprecated Status Code Function**:
   - Consider creating a `checkForDeprecatedStatus` function to centralize the deprecation checks on all status code assignments in responses.

5. **Testing Adjustments**:
   - Add tests specifically targeting new branches introduced in this PR.
   - Address io.js inconsistencies with Node.js by skipping relevant tests on io.js builds, following the behavior discrepancies documented.

6. **Finalization and Testing**:
   - Ensure that the newly implemented logic is covered by tests, final adjustments for test coverage are made, and align tests to cover generalized `res.status` functionality.
   - Check for any presence of missing lines causing test failures and add necessary test cases to maintain test coverage requirements.

This PR prepares the codebase for upcoming breaking changes related to status code handling in version 5, emphasizing consistent deprecation handling and backward compatibility through strategic code adjustments and thorough testing.
