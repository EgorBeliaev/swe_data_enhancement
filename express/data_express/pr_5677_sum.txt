**Instructions for the Programmer:**

1. **Dependency Update:**
   - Remove the `array-flatten` dependency from `package.json`.
   - Update any code using `array-flatten` to leverage the native JavaScript `Array.prototype.flat` method directly.

2. **Code Modification:**
   - In `lib/application.js`, eliminate any variable declarations of `flatten` that use `Array.prototype.flat`. Instead, apply the `flat` method directly.
   - Specifically, replace this code:
     ```javascript
     var flatten = Array.prototype.flat;
     var fns = flatten.call(slice.call(arguments, offset), Infinity);
     ```
     with:
     ```javascript
     var fns = slice.call(arguments, offset).flat(Infinity);
     ```

3. **General Code Quality:**
   - Ensure that the code style remains consistent with the existing codebase.
   - Verify that the refactored code correctly handles deeply nested arrays using `flat(Infinity)`. 

These changes are based on updating to a minimum Node.js version that supports the `Array.prototype.flat` natively. Please ensure the CI/CD pipeline is updated accordingly to support Node versions starting from 11 and above.
