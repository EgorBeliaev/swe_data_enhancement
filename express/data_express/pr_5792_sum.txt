**Super Condensed Instructions:**

1. **Purpose of PR**: The PR aims to ensure `res.clearCookie()` correctly deletes cookies by ignoring `expires` and `maxAge` options.

2. **Implementation Detail**: 
   - Override any `expires` value set for cookies.
   - Explicitly remove `maxAge` from the options object used in `res.clearCookie()` to prevent unintended `expires` setting into the future.

3. **ESLint Configuration**:
   - Avoid using spread syntax due to an eslint configuration issue.
   - Update syntax to use `Object.assign()` to prevent eslint parsing errors, as the current configuration lacks `ecmaVersion` 2015 support.
   
4. **CI and Branch Dependencies**:
   - Address branch protection and CI configuration issues on the 5.0 branch, which incorrectly requires Node 22 job from the master's CI.
   - Note that the master's CI, required for PRs to 5.0, is not triggered due to outdated configurations.
   - Evaluate whether these CI issues are independent of this PR and address them separately as feasible.

5. **Branch and Merge Strategy**:
   - Recognize dependencies between the 5.0 branch and the merge PR requiring 5.0-specific changes.
   - Plan to conduct a final sync after the next v4 release before merging to the 5.0 branch.

The intent is to make necessary code adjustments for res.clearCookie(), while managing CI and branch configuration issues to ensure successful integration into the 5.0 branch.
