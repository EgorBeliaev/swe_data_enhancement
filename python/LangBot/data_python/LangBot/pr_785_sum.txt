The GitHub Pull Request discussion describes a bug fix to restore compatibility in the handling of `query.resp_messages`. Currently, `query.resp_messages` supports elements of type `Message` and `mirai.MessageChain`. The issue arises when plugins use `PersonCommandSent` or `PersonNormalMessageReceived` to pass `mirai.MessageChain` as a reply; in these cases, the message chain assignment bypasses the wrapper stage in the pipeline and is directly assigned to `query.resp_message_chain`. This compatibility was broken in a previous version due to refactoring, and the PR aims to fix this.
