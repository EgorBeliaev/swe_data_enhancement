**Instruction:**

Update the repository to fix the issue where the `aiocqhttp` `mirai.Voice` type is unable to correctly transmit URL and base64 encoded data. Ensure the following:

1. Verify and document any new configuration file fields if they've been added.
2. Provide documentation for any new features if necessary.
3. Conduct testing on the new functionality or changes made.
4. Ensure version compatibility is addressed.
5. Handle any plugin compatibility issues if needed (though this is currently unchecked).

**Note:** Assure that potential or known issues are identified and documented.
