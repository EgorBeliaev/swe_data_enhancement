**Instruction for Fix:**

1. **Problem**: The `aiocqhttp` library cannot send images because the handling of base64-encoded messages is missing.

2. **Solution**: 
   - Modify the function responsible for processing messages to include a check for base64 attributes.
   - Implement the following code snippet in the relevant section:

     ```python
     if hasattr(msg, "base64"):
         arg = msg.base64
         msg_list.append(aiocqhttp.MessageSegment.image(f"base64://{arg}"))
     ```

This change will correctly process and send images as base64-encoded data, resolving issue #778.
