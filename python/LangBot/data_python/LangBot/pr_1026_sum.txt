Remove the line `message = ''` from the `target2yiri` method in the `QQOfficialMessageConverter` class within `pkg/platform/sources/qqofficial.py` to prevent clearing the `message` variable which results in an empty `Plain` component during message parsing. Ensure that the function continues to return a properly constructed `MessageChain` with the original message content.
