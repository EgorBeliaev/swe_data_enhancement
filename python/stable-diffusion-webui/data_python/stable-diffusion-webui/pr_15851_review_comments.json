The last version with x64 binaries is 2.2.0, but that version does not work properly on MacOS 14.4+. The last version of [PyTorch that works on Intel Macs with MacOS 14.4+](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/2992#issuecomment-2021435493) is 2.1.2.\r\n\r\nI have added CPU check and different TORCH_COMMANDs for Intel and ARM.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read [contributing wiki page](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Contributing)\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] My code follows the [style guidelines](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Contributing#code-style)\r\n- [x] My code passes [tests](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Tests)\r\n\r\n"
