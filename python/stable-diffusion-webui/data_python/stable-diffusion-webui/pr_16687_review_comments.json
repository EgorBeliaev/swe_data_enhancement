        "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n- **Simple Description:** Currently, the setting for the image formats is a `Textbox`, without any validation for it afaik during my brief tracing. So if the user made a typo or entered an unsupported format, it would simply raise errors when saving images.\r\n    - (I just checked, apparently entering `.png` will still save without errors, with the filename simply being `<filename>..png`; *~~But surely this would cause problems somewhere else?~~*)\r\n\r\n- **Summary of Changes:** Added `gr.Dropdown` to the options, with a list of supported formats as the `choices`\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read [contributing wiki page](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Contributing)\r\n- [X] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [X] My code follows the [style guidelines](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Contributing#code-style)\r\n- [X] My code passes [tests](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Tests)\r\n"

If using `gr.Dropdown`, should we also enable `allow_custom_value`?\r\n3. Should we have a central list of all supported formats in somewhere like `images.py`\r\n    - *And have I missed any formats?*"
