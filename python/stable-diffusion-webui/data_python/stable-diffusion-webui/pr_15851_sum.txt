**Instruction for Implementation:**

1. **Issue Identification**: The repository needs to support PyTorch on both Intel and ARM Macs due to a breaking issue with PyTorch 2.3.0 on MacOS 14.4+.

2. **Solution Overview**:
   - Implement CPU detection to differentiate between Intel and ARM Macs.
   - Configure separate `TORCH_COMMANDs` for each architecture.

3. **Specific Version Requirements**:
   - Use PyTorch version 2.3.0 for ARM Macs (fixes critical issues on MacOS).
   - Use PyTorch version 2.1.2 for Intel Macs (the last compatible version for MacOS 14.4+).

4. **Technical Details**:
   - Ensure the CPU check logic is robust and accurately determines the architecture.
   - Update installation or setup scripts to include the conditional `TORCH_COMMANDs`.

5. **Compliance**:
   - The implementation must adhere to the repository's contributing and coding style guidelines.
   - Ensure the changes pass all existing tests.
