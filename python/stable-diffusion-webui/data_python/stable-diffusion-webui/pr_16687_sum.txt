**Change Summary and Instructions:**

1. **Purpose**: Convert the current image format selection from a `Textbox` to a `gr.Dropdown` to prevent errors related to unsupported formats or typos when saving images.
   
2. **Implementation Changes**:
   - Replace the existing image format input `Textbox` with `gr.Dropdown`.
   - Populate `gr.Dropdown` with a list of supported image formats as the `choices`.

3. **Considerations**:
   - `DropdownEditable` is being used to allow flexibility for additional image formats (e.g., gif, bmp), although manual input compatibility is not guaranteed. 
   - Clarify this feature by linking to the [PIL documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html) and adding an info message: "manual input of other formats is possible, but compatibility is not guaranteed."

4. **Discussion Points**:
   - It was suggested to centralize the list of supported formats in an appropriate file like `images.py`.
   - A comparison between two layout designs for displaying information suggested design 'B' is preferred; this design likely involves a clearer distinction between standard and advanced settings for end-users.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - All participants agree with the proposed changes, with no further modifications needed before merging.
