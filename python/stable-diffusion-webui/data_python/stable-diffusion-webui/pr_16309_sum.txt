Title: Fix Default System None Filter Logic

Instructions:
1. Review the logic associated with the 'None' filter to ensure it properly prevents writing equivalent values to files, which could bloat default output.
2. If needed, adjust the logic by adding a parenthesis around the new value or section to correct its functionality.
3. Validate the fix through testing to ensure it functions as intended.

Issue Description:
The existing 'None' filter logic might be incorrect, potentially allowing unnecessary equivalent values to be written, thereby bloating the output files. This PR aims to rectify that logic issue.
