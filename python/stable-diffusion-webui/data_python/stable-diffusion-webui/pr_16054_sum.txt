### Instructions for the Programmer:

1. **Bug Fix**:
   - Address the unnecessary sampler scheduler autocorrection warning that occurs with sampler `DPM++ 2M` and scheduler `Karras`.
   - Resolve the issue in `get_sampler_and_scheduler()` function by adding a new argument `convert_automatic: bool` to disable reverting to 'Automatic' when it's the default scheduler for the selected sampler.

2. **Additional Change**:
   - Remove a leftover line of comment from the code as indicated in the [PR 15988](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/pull/15988).

### Issue Description:
The PR fixes a confusing warning triggered under certain circumstances where the default schedule of `DPM++ 2M` is mistakenly flagged due to a mismatch between `Automatic` and `Karras`. The warning is harmless to functionality but misleading for users. The solution involves modifying function behavior to prevent this false warning.
