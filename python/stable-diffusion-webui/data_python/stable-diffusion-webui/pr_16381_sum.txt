**Instruction:**

Implement handling of duplicate `elem_id` in `InputAccordion`:

1. Modify `InputAccordion` to track previously used `elem_id`. For each duplicate, append a unique number to the `elem_id`.
2. Add an `on_script_unloaded` callback to clear/reset `accordion_id_set` and `global_index` to maintain cleanliness. Place this callback registration inside the class to avoid making code structure complex.
3. Ensure compatibility enhancement without making assumptions on specific use cases, such as JavaScript reliance, which may require manual intervention and fixes as per PR #16373.
4. This implementation is complementary and not a replacement for the solution in PR #16373; it provides a stopgap that ensures broken code functions by resolving `elem_id` collisions when the problem arises.
