**Issue:** The repository encounters an `OSError` when attempting to save an image in 'P' mode as a JPEG. This occurs when using the function `encode_pil_to_base64` with 'P' mode images and specifying 'jpeg' as the save format. The problem can also arise with the `assign_current_image` function.

**Instructions for Programmer:**
1. Investigate the cause of the `OSError` when converting 'P' mode images to JPEG format.
2. Ensure `encode_pil_to_base64` handles 'P' mode images appropriately by either converting them to a supported format before saving or providing a clear error message.
3. Verify if similar handling is required in the `assign_current_image` function.
4. Make necessary code adjustments to prevent this error, ensuring compatibility without loss of functionality in the process.
