The issue addressed by this PR pertains to a bug encountered when switching to a Stable Diffusion 2.1 (sd2.1) model checkpoint, resulting in a "NotImplementedError." The problem arises due to the computation being executed on CPU instead of GPU, which does not support the necessary operations for inference. The root cause is linked to the usage of `device = devices.cpu` in the `is_using_v_parameterization_for_sd2` function, as identified in a specific commit. The patch provided resolves this issue by ensuring compatible execution on supported devices, thus eliminating the error. Ensure GPU computations are performed to support the necessary operators.
