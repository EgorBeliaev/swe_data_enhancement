**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Objective**: Replace the use of `wsl-open` with a combination of `wslpath` and `explorer.exe` for directory opening in WSL.
   
2. **Implementation**:
    - Use the following Python code snippet to convert a WSL path to a Windows path and open it using `explorer.exe`:
      ```python
      subprocess.Popen(["explorer.exe", subprocess.check_output(["wslpath", "-w", path])])
      ```
    - Note that combining this into a single subprocess call using bash was considered but avoided due to concerns with escaping and quoting characters.

3. **Testing**:
    - The approach was tested in a standalone script within WSL and works as expected.
    - Comprehensive cross-WSL version testing is not completed.

4. **Document your adherence** to the project's contributing guidelines, perform a self-review, ensure code style compliance, and confirm passing of project tests.
