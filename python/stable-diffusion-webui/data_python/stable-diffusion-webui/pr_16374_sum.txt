**Instruction to Programmer:**

Fix the `Simple Upscale` script visibility:

1. Update the `ScriptPostprocessing` class:
   - Add attributes: `extra_only` and `main_ui_only`. 
   - Set these attributes to `True` to control the visibility of scripts in specific tabs.

2. Apply changes to `Simple Upscale`:
   - Set the `.main_ui_only` attribute to `True` for `Simple Upscale`.
   - Ensure it appears only in the main UI when included in `opts.postprocessing_enable_in_main_ui`.

3. Modify `shared_items.postprocessing_scripts`:
   - Introduce filter options: `filter_out_extra_only` and `filter_out_main_ui_only` to exclude specific script types from rendering.

**Objective:** Ensure that scripts can selectively appear in their respective tabs without special casing, allowing extensions the flexibility to limit tab visibility, as needed.
