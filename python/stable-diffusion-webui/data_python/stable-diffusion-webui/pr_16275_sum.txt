**Instructions for Fixing Image Upscale on CPU:**

1. **Issue Identification**: There is a known issue with image upscaling using the CPU in `stable-diffusion-webui` after merging changes from PR #16144. The upscaling process fails with the error: `RuntimeError: Inplace update to inference tensor outside InferenceMode`.

2. **Proposed Fix**: Switch from using `no_grad` to `inference_mode` to resolve the runtime error during CPU-based upscaling.

3. **Testing Note**:
   - The error was initially observed when using `torch+cuda` with `--use-cpu all` argument.
   - Both CPU and CUDA versions of Torch failed upon retesting the current setup.

4. **Impact**: The issue affects primarily users who rely on CPU for image upscaling, not limited to this specific setup.

5. **Suggested Action**: Implement a version 1.10.1 patch to address this issue in the `stable-diffusion-webui` repository.

6. **Verification**:
   - Ensure that changes pass all existing tests.
   - Confirm adherence to style guidelines.
   - Conduct a self-review and verify against the contributing guidelines. 

This summary provides essential instructions and issue description for fixing the aforementioned bug in the repository.
