Add an option in the XYZ plot script to disable the grid stitching feature. Organize the XYZ options by grouping grid-related options under an `InputAccordion` titled `Draw grid`. Allow users to enable/disable grid drawing; if disabled, no grid will be produced. Ensure compatibility with existing options `Include Sub Images` and `Include Sub Grids` to enable users to control output preferences. Ensure the changes are in line with the project's style guidelines and pass all tests.
