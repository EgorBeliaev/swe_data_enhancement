        "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhen generating grids, some scripts such as img2img loopback and ultimate SD upscale do not pass infotexts for each image since they are the same prompt.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to save those images using the saved button in the UI it will fail because it will look for the selected image info text. This fixes those errors by replicating the infotext for as many images are passed into the image list if the infotext parameter is none.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x ] I have read [contributing wiki page](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Contributing)\r\n- [ x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [ x] My code follows the [style guidelines](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Contributing#code-style)\r\n- [ x] My code passes [tests](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Tests)\r\n"
