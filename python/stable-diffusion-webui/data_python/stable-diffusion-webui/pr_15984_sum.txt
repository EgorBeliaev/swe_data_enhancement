**Instruction for Implementation:**

Implement the `process_before_every_sampling` hook, as originally seen in SD Forge. This hook should facilitate easier handling of the txt2img HR pass. Ensure to integrate it so extensions can utilize this new hook instead of the existing `process` hook. Follow repository style guidelines, and ensure all tests pass before submission.
