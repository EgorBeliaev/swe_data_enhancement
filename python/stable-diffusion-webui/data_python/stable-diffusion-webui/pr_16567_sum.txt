**Instruction to Programmer:**

- Implement support for automatic detection of SDXL V-prediction models by checking for the `v_pred` key in the `state_dict`.
- Ensure compatibility with ztSNR, aligning with what has been supported as of version 1.8.0, catering to models on par with NovelAI's V3 model.
- Add functionality to include `v_pred` and `ztsnr` keys for models lacking them using the provided Python snippet, utilizing `safetensors.torch` to load and save models.
- Rectify config loading issues when using the same base model architecture.

Ensure code quality and adherence to contribution guidelines as per the checklist items fulfilled by the author.
