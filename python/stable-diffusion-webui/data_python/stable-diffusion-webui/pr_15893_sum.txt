Fix the bug where an extra `.` is incorrectly inserted between the file base name and the extension when the `extension` argument is `"jpg"`, `"jpeg"`, or `"webp"`, and image dimensions exceed their format's limits. Adjust logic to prevent the `extension` variable from including an additional `.` before `"png"`. Ensure that the `fullfn` variable correctly constructs filenames without doubling the period, resulting in formats like `filename.png` instead of `filename..png`.
