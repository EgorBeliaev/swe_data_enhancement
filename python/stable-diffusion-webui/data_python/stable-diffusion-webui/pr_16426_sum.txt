**Instruction for Programmer:**

Modify the modal image viewer behavior when `opts.js_live_preview_in_modal_lightbox` is disabled to ensure the full-page view immediately shows the result image without briefly displaying the live preview image. This update addresses and resolves the flicker issue introduced in PR #14230. Ensure compliance with style guidelines and pass all tests.
