        "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nTitle. Based on the detection [here](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/7390ff3b1ec2e15017ba4a52d6eaabc4aa4636e3/comfy/supported_models.py#L198), where the existence of a `v_pred` key in the `state_dict` is checked.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is due to an emerging model being trained with V-pred (currently only useable with an additional config file next to the model file) and ztSNR ([supported as of 1.8.0](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/pull/14145)) that is on par with NovelAI's closed source V3 model. The hope is this will reduce friction and increase user adoption.\r\n\r\nExample model: https://civitai.com/models/833294?modelVersionId=1046043\r\n\r\nIf you wish to modify existing models that do not have these keys added, it's straightforward to do so.\r\n```python\r\nfrom safetensors.torch import load_file, save_file\r\nimport torch\r\nstate_dict = load_file('/path/to/model.safetensors')\r\nstate_dict['v_pred'] = torch.tensor([])\r\nstate_dict['ztsnr'] = torch.tensor([])  # Added for PR #16569\r\nsave_file(state_dict, '/path/to/new_model.safetensors')\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis also fixes config loading when the same base model architecture is being utilized.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read [contributing wiki page](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Contributing)\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] My code follows the [style guidelines](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Contributing#code-style)\r\n- [x] My code passes [tests](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Tests)\r\n"
