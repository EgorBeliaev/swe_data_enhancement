**Instruction for Implementation:**

1. **Add Toggle Button:**
   - Implement a button in the image viewer to toggle the setting `Show Live preview in full page image viewer`.
   - Ensure that the toggle button does not update the settings; it should only use the current settings as default.

2. **Icon Design:**
   - Evaluate the current icon choice and positioning for the toggle button.
   - Consider using icons such as ðŸ—†/â§† (asterisk in or not in square) for better representation.

3. **Reference Existing Functions:**
   - The mechanism for sending previews to the full-screen gallery was implemented in previous patches: 
     - PR #13459
     - PR #14230
     - PR #14307
   - Review these PRs to understand the existing logic and integrate the toggle functionality accordingly.

4. **Additional Considerations:**
   - Look into black and white emoji renditions for potential icon choices.
   - Maintain existing standards and practices as per the project's style guidelines.
