**Instruction:**

Update `install.py` to ensure the ffmpeg installation works correctly during setup. Specifically, modify the `subprocess.check_call` call when executing conda commands by adding the `shell=True` parameter to ensure proper conda environment initialization. This resolves a `FileNotFoundError` occurring during execution.
