**Instruction for Changes:**

Implement a feature for automatically selecting the optimal PyPI source for `pip`. The implementation should include:

- **Persistent Test Results:** Enable saving of test results such that when the installation program is run again, it can utilize the results from the previous test.
- **Test Result Validity:** Set a validity period for the test results to one hour.
- **Multiple PyPI Mirrors:** Incorporate multiple PyPI mirror sources to optimize for the user's geographical location.

This enhancement is aimed at improving installation efficiency by choosing the most suitable PyPI source automatically and ensuring reusability of previous results within a specific time frame.
