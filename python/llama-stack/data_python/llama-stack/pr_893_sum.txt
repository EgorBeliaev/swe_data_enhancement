The Chroma adapter method signature is incorrect and needs to be fixed. To verify the fix, start the Chroma server using `chroma run --path /tmp/foo/chroma2 --host localhost --port 6001`. Update `run.yaml` to include the Chroma server pointing to `localhost:6001`, then run `llama stack run`. Finally, execute the test command `LLAMA_STACK_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8321 pytest -s -v agents/test_agents.py -k rag` to ensure the fix resolves the issue.
