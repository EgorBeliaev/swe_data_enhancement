### Instruction for Implementation:

1. **Change Input Handling:**
   - Update `ImageContentItem` to accept `image.data` as a Base64 string instead of binary bytes.

2. **Adjust Prompt Adapter:**
   - Modify the `prompt_adapter` to accommodate the change in how `image.data` is handled.

3. **Testing:**
   - Ensure the changes pass the tests by running `pytest -v tests/client-sdk/inference/test_inference.py`.
   - Validate against the tests mentioned in the linked PR discussion.

Make sure to check any relevant discussions and possibly linked resources in the PR discussion to guide these changes for coherence with existing codebase strategy or if specific requirements are mentioned.
