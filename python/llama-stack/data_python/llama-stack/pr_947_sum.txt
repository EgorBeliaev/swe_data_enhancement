**Instructions for Programmer:**

1. **Fixes to Implement:**
   - Fix the broken `pgvector` provider.
   - Ensure all cursor object creations are wrapped with context managers to prevent potential memory leaks.

2. **Testing Instructions:**
   - Run the test file `llama_stack/providers/tests/vector_io/test_vector_io.py` with the `pytest` command provided in the PR description. This will include setting the necessary environment variables for `pgvector`.

3. **Additional Actions:**
   - Check if there is a fixture for `pgvector`. If not, create one to facilitate future tests.
   - Review any additional fixes mentioned in the PR for potential issues with the current `pgvector` setup and address them as needed.
