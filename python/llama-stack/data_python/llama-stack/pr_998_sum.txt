**Instruction:**

Modify the RAG examples in the repository to ensure that a new FAISS index is created each time the example is run, instead of using the same index. This prevents the index from filling up with duplicate entries and prevents degradation of model performance by avoiding the risk of multiple irrelevant chunks being picked multiple times. Re-run the getting started guide multiple times to confirm consistent output, resolving the issue discussed in the provided GitHub discussion link.
