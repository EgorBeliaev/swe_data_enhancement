This PR addresses an issue in the llama-stack repository where running a distribution without first executing `llama stack build` results in an unhelpful `AttributeError`, indicating the client was not properly initialized. The PR introduces an exception handling mechanism for `AttributeError` to provide a more informative error message when methods like `models.list()` are called on an improperly initialized client. 

**Instructions:**
1. Implement an exception handling block for `AttributeError` when users call functions such as `models.list()` without building the llama stack. The error should clearly state that the client is not properly initialized.
2. Confirm that the new error handling mechanism correctly catches the exception during local executions, using the test script provided in the documentation: https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/index.html#run-inference-with-python-sdk
3. Ensure all necessary pre-checks are completed before submission, including:
   - Running pre-commit for linting/formatting.
   - Reviewing the contributor guidelines for the Pull Request section.
   - Updating relevant documentation.
   - Writing appropriate unit or integration tests.
