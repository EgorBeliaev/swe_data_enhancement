**Instructions for the Programmer:**

1. **Refactor Code:**
   - Move the logic for model availability checks into a new function named `check_model_availability`.
   - Replace redundant code by calling `check_model_availability` in both embedding and non-embedding model registration.

2. **Update Tests:**
   - Focus testing on the `test_register_nonexistent_model` function within the unit tests as per the requirement.
   - Ensure tests demonstrate how Ollama is started and which models are loaded.

3. **Test Plan & Documentation:**
   - Verify that the updated test plan includes explicit steps for running Ollama with models `llama3.2:3b-instruct-fp16` and `llama3.1:8b`. 
   - Ensure documentation is updated with relevant details as per contributor guidelines.
   - Confirm all relevant unit or integration tests are written and pass.

4. **Attention to Known Failures:**
   - Address the failure in `test_register_with_llama_model` related to the unavailability of the 'custom-model'.
   - Fix the issue in `test_initialize_model_during_registering` where `load_model` is not being called as expected.

5. **Pre-Submission Checklist:**
   - Ensure to run `pre-commit` hooks for linting and formatting.
   - Review the contributor guidelines, specifically the section on submitting pull requests.
