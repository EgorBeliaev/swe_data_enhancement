Title: Fix Agents to Support Code and RAG Simultaneously

Instruction: 

1. Address and fix the bug causing agents to malfunction when both RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and code-interpreter are used together as tools.
2. Implement a test case in the `client_sdk` to verify that RAG and code-agent can operate simultaneously without issues.
3. Execute the provided test command to ensure functionality:
   ```bash
   LLAMA_STACK_CONFIG=together pytest -s -v tests/client-sdk -k 'test_rag_and_code_agent'
   ```
4. Remove or eliminate the usage of `.context` as indicated by the reviewer feedback.

This PR is vital to ensure effective simultaneous use of specified tools without interference, addressing current issues in agent operability.
