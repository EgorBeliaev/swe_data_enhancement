The pull request proposes the following change:

**Change Specification:**
1. **Shortcomings in Current Implementation:**
   - The current approach involves a shortcut to guess if data is an extension of the original data, which leads to incorrect updates, particularly affecting charts such as `vega_lite_chart`. The primary concern is the premature caching optimization that compares only the first and last elements of data arrays, resulting in incorrect assumptions about data similarity.
   
2. **Proposed Solution:**
   - Remove the `dataIsAnAppendOfPrev` optimization entirely.
   - Implement a data hash comparison to ensure full data replacement when changes are detected:
     ```typescript
     if (prevData.hash !== data.hash) {
         view.data(name, getDataArray(data))
     }
     ```
   - Start with a lightweight hash to determine if the data set has changed and plan to transition to a backend-calculated hash, potentially required for lazy-loading.

3. **Testing and Verification:**
   - Manual tests should ensure that adding rows triggers an insert without considering it new data and that unchanged data does not cause updates.
   - Verify that chart data updates correctly, as the current optimization often fails to detect necessary updates when the chartâ€™s dataset changes, but the chart path remains the same.

This PR closes issue #6689, which involves incorrect data rendering in `vega_lite_chart` due to caching optimizations, detailing the problem and steps to address these issues.
