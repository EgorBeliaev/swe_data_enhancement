**Instruction for Changes:**

- The issue with the dataframe column menu in dialogs/popovers is due to `position: fixed` not working properly in these contexts because they use a transform that affects the fixed position.
- Move the column menu inside the dataframe portal div, the same one used for cell overlays, to resolve this issue.
- Ensure that the fix is tested with the newly added end-to-end (e2e) test.
- Note that the changes will close the issue: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10357.
