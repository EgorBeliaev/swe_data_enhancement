### Instruction for Programmer:

Modify the `test_get_url` unit test to remove the automatic port selection behavior. Enforce the use of port `8501` explicitly when executing the test suite locally, addressing issues that arise when this port is already in use by other applications, such as a development instance of Streamlit.
