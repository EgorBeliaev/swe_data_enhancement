        "body": "## Describe your changes\r\nOne of our `StatusWidget` JS unit tests will fail during the New Years timeframe (between 12/31 & 1/06) where we display the fireworks gif instead of the running man gif as it tests the `img` tag's `src` attribute. This PR makes a small adjustment to the test to set the system time to ensure stability. See failure message below from nightly run [here](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/actions/runs/12556422755/job/35007726954):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"750\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-30 at 11 54 19\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2f698ab-4fdc-4213-9ac3-8afa80238801\" />\r\n\r\n"
