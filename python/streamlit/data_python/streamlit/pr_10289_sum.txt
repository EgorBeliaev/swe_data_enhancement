**Title**: [Fix] `MetricsManager` parse error

**Objective**: Remove unnecessary JSON parsing for `anonymousId` stored in localStorage.

**Details**:

1. **Context**: Previously, `JSON.parse` was used to handle excess quotes from Segment's `anonymousId` logic, causing console errors.
   
2. **Update Logic**:
   - Eliminate `JSON.parse` where it was used for resolving `anonymousId` from localStorage.

3. **Testing**:
   - Extensive manual testing is conducted across different scenarios:
     - No storage of `anonymousId`
     - `anonymousId` in localStorage only
     - `anonymousId` in cookies only
     - `anonymousId` in both localStorage and cookies

**Considerations**:
- The legacy `anonymousId` format can be maintained in localStorage without causing functional issues, despite potential excess quotes.
