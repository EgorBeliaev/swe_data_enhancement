To fix this, we are putting the column menu inside the dataframe portal div that is also used for the cell overlays.  \r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\n- Closes https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10357\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Added e2e test\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n"
