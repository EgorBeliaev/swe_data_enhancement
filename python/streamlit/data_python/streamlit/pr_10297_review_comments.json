        "body": "## Describe your changes\r\nIn the effort to decouple a connection package from @streamlit/lib, we are looking for easy ways to consolidate imports so that the dependency tree is simpler (and lib is less the keeper of all things).\r\n\r\nRight now the connection relies on SessionInfo for one thing, getting the last sessionId. This change converts it to a function that can be provided easily.\r\n\r\nSmall, but I also refactored out `ensureError`. It's one of those, \"Sure, it's convenient, but do we really need it?\" This was designed mostly to ensure typescript compatibility, so incorrect usage will be flagged and the conditional is just as easy.\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Tests should pass\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n"
