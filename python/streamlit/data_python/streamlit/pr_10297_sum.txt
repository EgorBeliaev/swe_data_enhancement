**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Objective**: Decouple the `SessionInfo` from the connection package in `@streamlit/lib`.

2. **Changes to Implement**:
   - Replace the direct reliance on `SessionInfo` for obtaining the last `sessionId` with a function that can be easily provided to the necessary components.
   - Remove the `ensureError` function. This function was primarily included to ensure TypeScript compatibility, but its necessity is questioned. Adopt conditional checks instead.

3. **Testing**:
   - Ensure all existing tests pass without modifications to verify that no unintended side-effects occur from these changes.

4. **Licensing Agreement**:
   - This PR falls under the Apache 2.0 license, confirming compliance with open-source contribution guidelines.

The focus of this PR is to simplify the dependency structure of the connection package, making it less reliant on the overarching `lib` package, thereby achieving a cleaner modular design.
