**Instruction for Repository Update:**

1. **Remove `PerformanceEvents`:** Eliminate the `PerformanceEvents` feature from the codebase as it is now obsolete due to the migration to browser features.

2. **Purpose of Change:** The feature was primarily used for testing `fastReruns`, which is no longer necessary.

3. **Consider Logging Strategy:** Evaluate the current logging strategy and consider integrating a third-party library or developing a separate package for logging if needed.

4. **Testing:** Ensure that all existing tests pass to confirm that removal of `PerformanceEvents` does not introduce any new bugs.
