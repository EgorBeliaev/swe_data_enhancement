        "body": "## Describe your changes\r\nWhen the `anonymousId` used for our metrics is available in localStorage only, we previously used `JSON.parse` to resolve excess quotes coming from Segment's `anonymousId` logic. This is causing a console error and is no longer necessary with Segment's removal.\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n- **Manual Testing**: \u2705 Tested across the 4 scenarios below in Chrome, Firefox, Safari & Edge: \r\n    - No storage of `anonymousId`\r\n    - `anonymousId` in localStorage only \r\n    - `anonymousId` in cookies only \r\n    - `anonymousId` in both "

If its more problematic, an alternative might be to only apply the parse if it looks like its still from Segment. "
