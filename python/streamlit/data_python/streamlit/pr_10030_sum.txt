**Instruction for Changes:**

Update the visualization logic for feedback widgets to ensure that a visual indication remains when a feedback widget is both selected and disabled. Ensure that E2E tests are updated to capture the states of both enabled and disabled widgets when selected, with appropriate snapshots reflecting these changes.
