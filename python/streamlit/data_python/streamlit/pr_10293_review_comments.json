        "body": "## Describe your changes\r\n\r\nIn the effort to decouple a connection package from @streamlit/lib, we are looking for easy ways to consolidate imports so that the dependency tree is simpler (and lib is less the keeper of all things).\r\n\r\nHere BaseUriParts is a subset of URL in properties. The key difference is that the pathname by default has a `\"/\"` always in front. While it can be helpful, I believe it's better to leverage the URL type/convenience and just adjust the code for these differences.\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Tests should pass.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n"
