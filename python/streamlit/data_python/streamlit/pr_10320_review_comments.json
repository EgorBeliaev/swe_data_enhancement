        "body": "## Describe your changes\r\n\r\nWe have a Python dependency in Streamlit - `rich` - that is almost exclusively used in Community Cloud to get nicer formatting for exceptions in the log viewer. However, it is currently installed for all Streamlit installs, which is suboptimal. The dependency is already implemented in Streamlit in a way that it is optional (only used if installed). We have recently changed that `rich` gets auto-installed on Community Cloud, therefore, we can remove it from Streamlit's required dependencies. \r\n\r\nIn a follow-up after the release, we also plan to deprecate and eventually remove the `logger.enableRich` config option and always use `rich` if installed.\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- No logical changes. Rich is already an optional dependency in the code logic.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n"
