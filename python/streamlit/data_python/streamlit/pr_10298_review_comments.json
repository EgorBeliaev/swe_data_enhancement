This change was mainly used to test `fastReruns`, which is no longer necessary (On top of that, it seems like we should have a package for the logging, some third-party library, or a separate small package for this use case.\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Tests should pass\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n"
