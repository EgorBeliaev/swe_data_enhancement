**Instruction for Programmer:**

Fixes an issue where the dataframe's width setting is ignored when a different height is also provided. This is due to incorrect use of setting state in effects based on the previous state. Implement an end-to-end test to ensure the fix works correctly, and reference issue #9762 from the Streamlit GitHub repository which this PR addresses.
