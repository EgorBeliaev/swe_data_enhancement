        "body": "## Describe your changes\r\n\r\nThe move to Vite accidentally included source map files in the release build. This bloats the package size by a large amount. This change modifies `BUILD_AS_FAST_AS_POSSIBLE` to be `DEV_BUILD` where users can decide whether to enable source maps for the production build with `DEV_BUILD=1 make frontend`. As a result `make frontend` and `make frontend-fast` are the same, so we remove the `frontend-fast` option.\r\n\r\nNote `BUILD_AS_FAST_AS_POSSIBLE` is the opposite of `DEV_BUILD`, so we update the sourcemap config to be whether we want a DEV_BUILD or not.\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\ncloses #10008\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Tests should pass (and manually checked file size of wheel build) as sourcemaps don't affect the build.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n"

I was able to confirm it, the `static` folder is ~84mb in size, presumably because it contains the `.map.js` files. We recently switched from webpack to vite and I assume our production build process is slightly misconfigured. We will look into fixing this to get the size down again!"
