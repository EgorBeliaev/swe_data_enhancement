**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Dependency Update:** Remove `rich` from the list of required dependencies in the Streamlit project.

2. **Optional Usage:** Ensure that `rich` remains an optional dependency within the code logic, where it is used if installed but not required by default.

3. **Preparation for Future Changes:** Note the plan for a follow-up post-release to deprecate and eventually remove the `logger.enableRich` configuration option, transitioning to always using `rich` if it is available.

**Note:** There are no logical changes required since `rich` is already handled as an optional dependency in the code. The change primarily involves updating the dependency listing to no longer mandate `rich` installation for all Streamlit users.
