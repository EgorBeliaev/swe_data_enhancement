This allows us to fill the same screen estate regardless of the root font size -> which allows more compact apps by using a small font size.\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Update hostframe snapshots\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n"
