The issue being addressed in the PR is related to the `st.login()` function using Google as a provider within Streamlit. The error occurs when the provider name contains an underscore ('_'). The root cause of the issue is that the `state` token set by Authlib is prefixed with the provider name using an underscore as a delimiter. This results in a `ValueError` when attempting to parse the `state` due to having more underscores than expected.

**Instructions for the Programmer:**

1. **Raise an Exception:** Modify the implementation to raise an explicit exception when a provider name contains an underscore ('_'). This will prevent the improper state token creation and parsing issue.

2. **Update Documentation or Example Code:** Ensure the documentation or example code reflects this restriction on provider names, suggesting configurations like `googledev` instead of `google_dev`.

These changes are necessary to avoid issues with OAuth provider state token parsing in the `st.login()` function. Note that related tests are already completed, including unit tests for both JavaScript and Python, and presumably, E2E tests.
