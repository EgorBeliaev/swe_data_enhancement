Ensure release builds do not include source map files:

1. Modify the build environment configuration by replacing `BUILD_AS_FAST_AS_POSSIBLE` with `DEV_BUILD`.
2. Allow users to enable source maps for production builds using `DEV_BUILD=1 make frontend`.
3. Remove the `make frontend-fast` option as it is redundant.
4. Update the source map configuration to reflect the logic of `DEV_BUILD` (whether a DEV_BUILD is desired).
5. Verify that tests pass and manually confirm the reduced file size of the wheel build.
6. Reference: Addresses issue #10008, which identified that source map files increased package size significantly post transition from Webpack to Vite.
