### Changes to be Made:

1. **Model Personality Description and Updates:**
   - Implement the ability for the model to support personality descriptions and allow these personality configurations to be updated dynamically.
   - Ensure that the personality can be directly specified and locked to prevent re-specification during runtime, differing from the behavior seen in ChatGPT.

2. **System Message Simulation:**
   - Modify the current implementation where personality is simulated as the first item of the conversation history. Test inserting a system message object as both the first and last item in the history list.
   - If the above step results in the personality being overridden, implement a fixed personality description that cannot be altered by placing it alongside the simulated system message objects at the start and end of the conversation history.

3. **Naming Standardization:**
   - Apply a uniform naming convention to the robot or model entities within the repository.

### Issue Addressed:
- The PR addresses the inconsistencies and limitations in the way model personality is managed and updated, particularly in scenarios where the personality might be unintentionally changed. It introduces a robust method to fixate the personality settings as intended.
