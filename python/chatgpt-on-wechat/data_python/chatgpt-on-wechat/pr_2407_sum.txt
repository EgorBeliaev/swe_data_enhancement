### Instructions for Changes:
1. **Use `write_plugin_config()` Method**: Replace any direct modifications of the `plugin_config` dictionary with the `write_plugin_config()` method for better encapsulation and management of plugin configuration.
   
2. **Implement `remove_plugin_config()`**: Add a utility function, `remove_plugin_config()`, to clear a plugin's configuration from `plugin_config` before reloading. This ensures the old configuration is fully removed before applying the new settings.
   
3. **Update Plugin Config Management**: Ensure that all plugins utilize the `pconf()` method and `write_plugin_config()` for accessing and writing configurations. This will improve the consistency and reliability of configuration handling across all plugins. 

### Issue Fixed by This PR:
The issue involved the `reloadp` command not effectively reloading plugin configurations when plugin names included uppercase letters. This occurred because `load_config()` used the `pconf()` method, which searches in lowercase, but did not handle case sensitivity correctly when adding new entries. The fix ensures configurations are managed without direct access to `plugin_config` and clears old configurations to avoid mismatches.
