**Instruction for Programmer:**

Resolve the memory leak issue in the `scanp` command caused by handlers' reference to plugin instances by implementing the following change:

1. Clear the `handlers` of plugin instances before reassigning them in the `PluginManager`.
    ```python
    self.instances[name].handlers.clear()
    self.instances[name] = instance
    ```

2. Ensure this change is applied similarly to all cases where this issue might recur, particularly noted was a similar situation in `Event.ON_RECEIVE_MESSAGE`.

These alterations should help the garbage collector to appropriately dispose of previous plugin instances, thereby mitigating memory leak concerns.
