Title: 修复gemini 插件的两个问题

Instructions:
1. Update the gemini plugin to ensure that when an exception occurs while calling the gemini API, the error information is returned downstream. This will enable the subsequent handling process to implement appropriate compensation mechanisms based on the error information.
2. Fix the issue of index out-of-bounds errors that occur in special scenarios, causing the application to crash. Ensure the application can handle these scenarios gracefully without exiting unexpectedly.
