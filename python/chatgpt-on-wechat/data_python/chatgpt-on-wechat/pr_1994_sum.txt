### Instructions for Programmer:

1. **Bug Fixes and Enhancements:**
   - Fix the bug related to incorrect parameter values in `chat_channel` configuration.
   - Add support for `ContextType.IMAGE` to enable image-to-text and image-to-image generation when integrating with the Midjourney plugin.

2. **Optimization for DingTalk Integration:**
   - Optimize the DingTalk channel for a typewriter effect in streaming AI cards.
   - Enhance the `dingtalk_message` to properly handle receiving images or rich text.

3. **DingTalk Permissions and Documentation:**
   - Ensure interaction card interface permissions are added in the DingTalk developer app.
   - Update the existing tutorial to document the need for AI card streaming update permissions and interactive card instance write permissions.
   - Debug the response content for better accuracy in streaming AI card outputs.

4. **Code Logic Improvements:**
   - Consider merging the logic of `ContextType.IMAGE` with `ContextType.TEXT` for redundancy reduction.
   - Ensure the initial matching and filtering logic between reference and group or private chat logic is not redundant.

5. **Response Output Optimization:**
   - Consider integrating streaming outputs from large models (bots) with DingTalk's card streaming outputs to enhance response speed.

6. **Visibility Issue in DingTalk Groups:**
   - Set the `recipients` attribute to empty in `reply_with_ai_markdown()` within `dingtalk_channel.py` to allow AI markdown responses to be visible to all members in a group.

These instructions will address the current issues and implement new features and optimizations as discussed in the PR.
