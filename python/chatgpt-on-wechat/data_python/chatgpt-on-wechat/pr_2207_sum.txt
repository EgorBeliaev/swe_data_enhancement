Add lists `notes_join_group`, `notes_exit_group`, and `notes_patpat` to support character matching for joining group chats, exiting group chats, and pat-pat messages. Implement English language pattern matching for the terms 'invited', 'removed', and 'tickled' to ensure proper recognition when the WeChat client is set to English. This will also allow for easier future support of additional languages by adding to these lists and using conditional statements.
