**Instructions for Fixing the Repository:**

1. **Issue Identification:**
   - The bug involves the `aws_region` name not being utilized in `bedrock/invoke/`, caused by a recent refactor to `base_llm_http_handler`.
   - The root cause was insufficient testing for dynamic `aws_` authentication parameters propagation through `litellm.completion`.

2. **Resolution Steps:**
   - Implement comprehensive tests named `test_dynamic_aws_params_propagation` to verify the propagation of all `aws_` authentication parameters across all relevant AWS routes, including `/invoke` and `/converse`.

3. **Testing Requirements:**
   - Ensure all modified and coverable lines are tested to maintain full coverage, as confirmed by Codecov reports.
  
4. **Confirmation of Completion:**
   - Verify that the `litellm` project is marked as "Ready" after implementing the fix, as highlighted in the Vercel project status.

These steps aim to address the existing issue by enhancing test coverage and ensuring the proper functionality of AWS region handling in the Bedrock completions.
