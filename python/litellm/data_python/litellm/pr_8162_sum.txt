Support the Azure `o3` model family for the fake streaming workaround. Add `o3*` to the models list used for Azure's fake streaming workaround. Manually test fake streaming functionality with `o3-mini` and `o1-mini`; verify non-streaming works on `o3-mini`, and ensure real streaming is functional with `gpt-4o`. Relevant issue fixed: #8158. The existing tests for the Azure `o1` model may help, but setting up an `o3` deployment on Azure may be required for comprehensive testing.
