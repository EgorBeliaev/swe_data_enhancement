The Pull Request aims to fix a bug in the repository that deals with the `llm_api_route` detection for Vertex AI paths. According to the documentation, the expected path was `/vertex_ai/`, but it was not working. Instead, the path `vertex-ai` was being correctly detected. This PR addresses this issue by ensuring both `/vertex_ai/` and `/vertex-ai/` are recognized as valid `llm_api_route` paths.

### Instructions for Implementation:

1. **Bug Fix:**
   - Modify the route detection logic to ensure both `/vertex_ai/` and `/vertex-ai/` are accepted as valid paths for `llm_api_route` when handling requests associated with Vertex AI.

2. **Testing:**
   - Ensure that the changes are covered by tests. Write new test cases or update existing ones to verify that both `/vertex_ai/` and `/vertex-ai/` work as expected.
   - Attach a screenshot of any new tests passing locally as proof of successful implementation.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update any relevant documentation to reflect the corrected behavior, ensuring that developers are aware that both route patterns are now operational.

4. **Verification:**
   - Deploy the changes to a staging or testing environment and run a live test to confirm the fix.
