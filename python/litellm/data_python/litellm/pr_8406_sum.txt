**PR Title:** Allow editing model API key + provider on UI

**Changes to be made:**

1. **parallel_request_limiter.py:**
   - Reintroduce parallel request information in the max parallel request limiter function.

2. **model_management_endpoints.py:**
   - Implement a new PATCH endpoint `/model/{model_id}/update` to allow updating specific model values in the database. This should help the admin understand the update process easily.

5. **Code hygiene:**
   - Fix any outstanding linting errors in the affected files or areas of the codebase.
