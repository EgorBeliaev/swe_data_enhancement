### Instructions for Changes in the Repository:

1. **Remove Code Block**: 
   - Eliminate the existing code block responsible for inserting the master key hash into the database. This is a security fix to prevent risks associated with storing sensitive master keys in the database.

2. **Update .env Handling**:
   - Ensure that the master key is only retrieved from the machine's `.env` file and not stored in the database. This setup is now crucial for protecting sensitive information.

3. **Testing Requirement**:
   - Implement a new test to verify that the master key is not being inserted into the database during the system's startup. Confirm this security behavior and attach evidence of passing tests.

### Context:

- This change is necessary to mitigate the risk identified where local developer environments could inadvertently push master key information to a production database if misconfigured. 

**Note**: These changes are treated as a security fix, so priority attention is advisable.
