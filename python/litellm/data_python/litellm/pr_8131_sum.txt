**Instructions for Changes to be Made:**

1. **Fix the `top_k` Parameter Issue:**
   - Implement logic to correctly pass the `top_k` parameter for Bedrock Anthropic and Nova models.
   - Check model types and set the `top_k` parameter appropriately. 
   - Use the following approach based on the model:
     - **Nova Model**: 
       ```python
       additionalModelRequestFields = {
           "inferenceConfig": {
               "topK": 20
           }
       }
       ```
     - **Anthropic Model**: 
       ```python
       additional_model_fields = {"top_k": top_k}
       ```

2. **Potential Refactor Suggestion:**
   - Consider creating a new class for each model in the long term.
   - Implement model-specific handling logic for parameters within each class to avoid the main handler knowing these specifics.

3. **Simplify Additional Model Fields Creation Logic:**
   - Revise the logic associated with creating `additional_model_fields` for these models for ease of maintenance.

4. **Testing:**
   - Verify that the `top_k` parameter works correctly with real API calls across 4 different models.
   - Ensure all tests pass, including those using mocks.

5. **Reference:**
   - This fix addresses the issues in GitHub Issue #7782 and resolves input format inconsistencies that led to `BadRequestError` for Anthropic models.
