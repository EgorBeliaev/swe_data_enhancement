**Instructions:**

1. **Bug Fixes:**
   - Validate the existence of `pdf`, `docx`, and `json` properties in `data.output` before accessing them.
   - Check if paths in `accessData` already begin with `'outputs/'` before prepending it to avoid redundant path prefixes.

2. **Reversal:**
   - Ensure the "Download Logs" JSON link is conditionally displayed only when `report_type` is `'research_report'`.

3. **Refactoring:**
   - Remove unused logging configuration in `backend/server/server.py` that leads to the unnecessary creation of `server_log.txt`.
   - Delete the import of `setup_research_logging` and its associated startup code as they are redundant.
   - Confirm there are no changes to core logging functionalities â€” research outputs and logs should remain unchanged.

**Testing Requirements:**
   - Verify that research outputs continue to generate correctly in the `outputs` folder.
   - Ensure `server_log.txt` is not created.
   - Confirm existing logging functionality operates as expected after these modifications.
