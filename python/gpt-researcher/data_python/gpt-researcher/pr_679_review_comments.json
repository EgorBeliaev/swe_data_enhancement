        "body": "**Description:**\r\nThis PR introduces a function to sanitize directory names to ensure compatibility with Windows operating systems. The primary change is in the ChiefEditorAgent class, where the directory name for storing output files is now sanitized to replace invalid characters.\r\n\r\n**Changes Made:**\r\n- Added sanitize_filename function to replace invalid characters in directory names.\r\n- Updated ChiefEditorAgent to use the sanitize_filename function when creating output directories.\r\n\r\n**Background:**\r\nThe project was functioning correctly on Linux but encountered errors on Windows due to invalid characters in directory names (e.g., ?, *, |). This update addresses those issues by sanitizing the directory names, making the project cross-platform compatible."

This means that outputs are now not in this directory, but outside as `._outputs_run_...`. I suggest sanitizing only the file name within the string, will try to create a fixing PR soon"
