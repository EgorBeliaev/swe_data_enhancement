The actual research logging functionality is properly handled by `CustomLogsHandler`.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Removed unused logging configuration from `backend/server/server.py`\r\n- Removed unused `setup_research_logging` import and related startup code\r\n- No changes to core logging functionality (research outputs and logs remain intact)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Verified that research outputs still generate correctly in the `outputs` folder\r\n- Confirmed that `server_log.txt` is no longer created unnecessarily\r\n- All existing logging functionality continues to work as expected\r\n\r\n## Type of Change\r\n- [x] Code cleanup (non-breaking change that improves code organization)\r\n- [x] Performance improvement (removes unnecessary file operations)"
