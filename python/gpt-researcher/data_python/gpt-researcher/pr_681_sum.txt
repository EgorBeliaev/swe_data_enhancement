### Instruction for Programmer:

- **Objective**: Remove hardcoded dependencies on OpenAI and Tavily to enable the use of ollama and searx without relying on commercial services.
- **Note**: Ensure that the changes do not affect existing functionalities. Testing has only been done with ollama & searx/duckduckgo, so verify compatibility with other integrations.
- **Additional Suggestion**: Consider updating the PR title to clearly indicate it is a bugfix for improved clarity and documentation purposes.
