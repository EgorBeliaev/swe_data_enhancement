Sanitize directory names in the ChiefEditorAgent class to ensure compatibility with Windows by adding a `sanitize_filename` function. Focus on replacing invalid characters without altering directory structure (i.e., keep `outputs` directory intact). Only sanitize the individual directory names within the path, avoiding the full path sanitization issue.
