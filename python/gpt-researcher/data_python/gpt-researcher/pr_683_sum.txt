**Instructions for Implementation:**

1. **Default Retriever Correction:**
   - Modify the `get_retriever()` function to ensure the retriever can be set from the configuration. It currently defaults to a fixed retriever, ignoring configuration-based settings.
   - Introduce a new function to correctly obtain the default retriever without defaulting automatically to a predefined option.

2. **Path Sanitizing Fix:**
   - Update the sanitizing function to prevent unintended replacement of slashes in the paths. This approach is undesired as discussed in the linked issue within the comments of the PR.
