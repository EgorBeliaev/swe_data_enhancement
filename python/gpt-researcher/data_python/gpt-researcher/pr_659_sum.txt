Update the `generate_report_prompt` function by modifying its signature to accept a `tone` parameter. Incorporate logic to manage the `tone` parameter when provided. Refactor relevant function calls to include the `tone` parameter as needed. Ensure thorough commenting and documentation for clarity and maintainability. Conduct tests to confirm existing functionality remains intact and the new `tone` parameter is correctly processed. The goal is to resolve the TypeError and enhance the report generation process by allowing improved flexibility via the `tone` parameter.
