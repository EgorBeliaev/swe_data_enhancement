The change in this PR fixes a bug in the `GPTResearcher` class's constructor, which previously failed to use a default tone when none was provided. This issue caused errors when `GPTResearcher` was instantiated without specifying a tone, impacting APIs like the Multi_agents API deployed on Langgraph Cloud. Ensure the constructor now correctly defaults to an appropriate tone if none is specified.
