        "body": "### Default retriever\r\nIn the previous version, the default case in get_retriever() meant\r\nthat setting retriever from config (as opposed to the header) was\r\nignored, and instead, the default (tavily) retriever was chosen.\r\nAdded new function to get the default retriever.\r\n\r\n### Corrected sanitizing\r\nSanitizing function replaces the slashes in the path, which is\r\nmost likely undesired. Discussed in \r\nhttps://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher/pull/679#issuecomment-2235946414"
