**Issue Description:**

The repository has an issue in the `gp_researcher` package, specifically within the Google retriever module. A `KeyError` occurs when attempting to access the `snippet` key in a Google search result. This error arises when the search result lacks a `snippet`, which can happen due to read timeout errors (example host: `zyk.bjhd.gov.cn`, port: `443`, with a read timeout set at `4` seconds). This leads to the `gpt-researcher` crashing during operation when encountering these specific conditions.

**Instruction for Fix:**

Modify the Google retriever script located at `/home/winston/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/gp_researcher/retrievers/google/google.py` at or around line 83. Implement a check for the presence of the `snippet` key in `result` before attempting to access it. If `snippet` is missing, handle this scenario gracefully to prevent the application from crashing, possibly by logging the occurrence and skipping the entry or providing a fallback behavior.
