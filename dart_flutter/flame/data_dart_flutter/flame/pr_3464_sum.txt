### Instruction

- Update `SpawnComponent.periodRange` to change the range with each iteration by ensuring the `minPeriod` variable is set.

### Issue Being Fixed

The `SpawnComponent` was incorrectly not updating its range in each iteration because the `minPeriod` variable was unset. This PR corrects that behavior.
