**Instructions:**

Update the method for handling sprite assets in `SpriteButton` to prevent unnecessary loading. If both images for a `SpriteButton` are already loaded, do not use a future that results in loading for one tick. Ensure the code reflects this optimization.

**Details:**

- Update logic so that when assets for `SpriteButton` are already loaded, the system doesn't engage a redundant future load step.
- This change should not introduce any breaking changes to the current API.
- Confirm that all new or updated functionality has corresponding tests and documentation.
- Refer to the existing contributor guides for consistency in the implementation.
  
This PR shows minor benchmark changes, with a slight decrease in render component performance and a slight increase in update component time, which should be considered while integrating.
