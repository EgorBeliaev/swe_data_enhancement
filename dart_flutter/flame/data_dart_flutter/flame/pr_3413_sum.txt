Change the button behavior in the repository to set its size in the `onMount` method if the size is zero and not set automatically when the button is extended but size configuration is not passed into the constructor. Ensure this behavior persists even when the `button` child component fails to propagate the size. The PR is non-breaking, so no migration instructions are required.
