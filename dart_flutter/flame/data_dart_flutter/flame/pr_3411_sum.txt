### Instructions for Implementation:

1. **Modify `Resource` Class Behavior:**
   - Implement lazy loading for resource creation.
   - Ensure the `Resource` class has the capability to re-create resources when necessary.
   - Allow child classes to specify the need for resource re-creation using a `recreateResource` boolean.

2. **Testing:**
   - Update/add tests to cover all new and modified functionalities.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update/add relevant documentation in the `docs` directory.
   - Include dartdoc comments using `///` for documentation clarity.

4. **Examples:**
   - Update/add examples in the `examples` or `docs` directory to reflect the changes.

5. **Ensure Backward Compatibility:**
   - Confirm that the changes are not breaking; thus, no additional handling for breaking changes is necessary.

6. **Benchmark Considerations:**
   - Note the benchmark results: an increase in render time by 1.501% and a decrease in update time by 2.982%.
