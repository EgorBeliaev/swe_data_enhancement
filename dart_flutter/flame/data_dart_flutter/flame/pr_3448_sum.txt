**Instruction for Programmer:**

- The `.darken()` method is being corrected to restore its original functionality. Previously, `.darken(.98)` incorrectly darkened the image by 98%. The fix changes the behavior so that it now darkens the image by the inverse, which is 2%.
- Ensure that the examples reflect this change by updating the current example from 50% to 80% as indicated in the discussion.
- Check that documentation accurately describes the corrected behavior. Ensure any examples in the documentation are consistent with the change in functionality.
- Confirm that tests related to this behavior are updated or added to verify the fix.
