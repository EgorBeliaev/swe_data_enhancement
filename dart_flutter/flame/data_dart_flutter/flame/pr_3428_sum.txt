**Change Summary:**

The pull request fixes an issue in the system where adding a child to a parent that is removed in the same tick results in a faulty state. The correction involves ensuring that the child is added only after the parent has been unmounted.

**Instructions:**

1. Modify the system to delay adding a child to a parent if the parent is removed and to ensure the child is added only after the parent has been successfully unmounted.
2. Ensure that this update does not introduce any breaking changes to the existing API (`Marked as no breaking changes in the checklist`).
3. Update or add relevant tests to verify the expected behavior for all new or altered functionality.
4. Update or add necessary documentation and examples to reflect these changes.
5. Link this change to close issue #3416 as described in the PR.

**Repository Issue Being Fixed:**

- The system currently ends up in an incorrect state when a child is added to a parent that is removed in the same tick. This PR addresses that problem by revising the sequence of adding the child after the parent is unmounted.
