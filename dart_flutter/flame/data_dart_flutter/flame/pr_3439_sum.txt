Enhance the tests for `flame_markdown` by adding a second section to each test that asserts the element tree, following the assertion of the node tree. Implement a nested inline style test to ensure proper propagation and merging of "CSS". This change is non-breaking and all necessary tests, documentation, and examples updates are included. Benchmarks indicate negligible impact on rendering but slightly increased time in updating components.
