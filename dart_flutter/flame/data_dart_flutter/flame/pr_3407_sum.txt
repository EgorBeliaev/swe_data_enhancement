**Issue Description:**

The pull request addresses an issue with image data processing where the data is initially in a pre-multiplied state. The current process involves brightening these images without first converting them to straight alpha, leading to incorrect color adjustments that take colors to white. The suggestion is to implement a two-step process of converting the image data to straight alpha before brightening and then pre-multiplying it again. An alternative approach mentioned is to use the HSV color space to increase brightness through the 'Value' component for more accurate and subtle color retention.

**Instructions:**

1. Convert image data from pre-multiplied to straight alpha before applying any brightening effects.
2. After brightening, ensure the image data is re-converted back to the pre-multiplied state to maintain consistency.
3. Consider an alternative approach using HSV color space for increasing brightness by adjusting the 'Value' parameter, which maintains the image's color integrity better.
4. Extract any shared code between the processes of brightening and darkening to improve code reusability and efficiency.
