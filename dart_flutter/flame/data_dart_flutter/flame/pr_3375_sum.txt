**Instruction for Shadow3DDecorator Update**

- **Feature Addition:** Add a `baseColor` property to the `Shadow3DDecorator` to allow customization of shadow color, making it possible to use colors other than pure black.
- **Testing:** Implement a golden test as discussed, ensuring that the change is visually verifiable.
- **Documentation:** Update existing documentation and add any necessary DartDoc comments to reflect the new `baseColor` property.
- **Examples:** Ensure any relevant examples are updated, though this step is marked as incomplete in the checklist.
- **Non-Breaking Change:** This update is not a breaking change, so no migration instructions are required.
- **Testing Consideration:** Consider updating the `dynamically change shadow properties` test, though guidance on recreating the golden image is not clearly defined.
