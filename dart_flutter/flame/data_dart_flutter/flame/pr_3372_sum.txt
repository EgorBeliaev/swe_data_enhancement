### Instruction for Programmer

- **Add `WorldRoute`:** Implement the `WorldRoute`, which functions like a standard route but swaps the currently viewed world within the `RouterComponent`, allowing for dynamic changes to the camera's target world.

- **Documentation and Examples:** Ensure that the documentation is updated accordingly, and add relevant examples either in `examples` or the `docs` directory.

- **Test Coverage:** Though the PR checklist suggests tests have not been updated, consider updating or adding tests for the newly added functionality to ensure robustness.

- **Non-Breaking:** Note that this PR does not introduce any breaking changes. Existing users need not alter their applications to accommodate these updates.
