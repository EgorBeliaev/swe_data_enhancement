**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Feature Addition**: Implement support for strike-through text in the `flame_markdown` package.
   
2. **HTML Tag Parsing**: Ensure the `del` HTML tag is parsed and maps to a new inline text renderer within Flame's text rendering pipeline.

3. **Custom Property**: Introduce a new property that allows users to control the style of the strike-through text.

4. **Markdown Parser Configuration**: Ensure the markdown parser has the strikethrough option enabled (or a similar custom option) to parse `~~`-wrapped text into the new node element. Allow users to control this option if they provide their own document.

5. **Dictionary Update**: Update the dictionary to include "Strikethrough" as a single word, following Wikipedia's convention.

6. **Checklist Compliance**: Ensure all new/updated functionality is documented, tested, and added to examples as outlined in the Contributor Guide. Confirm no breaking changes are introduced.
