**Instruction to Programmer:**

Disable default HTML encoding when parsing markdown in `flame_markdown` module. The current default behavior negatively impacts the Flame text rendering pipeline since it doesn't accept HTML encoded sequences. Ensure users can still override this behavior if needed. Update/add tests, document the changes, and provide relevant examples. This change is non-breaking.
