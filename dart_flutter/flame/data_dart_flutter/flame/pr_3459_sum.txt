Add the ability to override the paint in the `NineTileBox` class, enabling the `NineTileBoxComponent` to incorporate `HasPaint`. This adjustment allows for the use of opacity and color effects on the component. Ensure all tests, documentation, and examples are updated accordingly. This change is not a breaking change and resolves issue #3430.
