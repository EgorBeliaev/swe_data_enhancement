**Instruction for Programmer:**

Update the Debouncer implementation in the mobile photos module to use a leading debouncer. This change will ensure that callbacks are executed immediately when the debounce timer is inactive, providing instant feedback in the UI, such as when deleting a file from the home gallery, where changes should reflect instantly rather than after the set debounce duration.
