**Instruction to Programmer:**

Modify the error handling in the server's user authentication component to report a 401 client error for invalid public key signatures instead of a 5xx server error. Specifically, change the response in the `UserHandler.FinishPasskeyAuthenticationCeremony` and `Repository.FinishAuthentication` methods to return a 401 status code when the assertion signature cannot be validated, with particular attention to handling cases where the signature is null.
