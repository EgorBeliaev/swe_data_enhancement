### Instructions for Implementation

1. **New Feature: Local Music Library**
   - Introduce a setting to add directories as "local libraries". These should not modify existing directories.
   - Integrate this with the "Local tracks" feature.

2. **UI Changes**
   - Relocate "Local Library" section from Settings to a new "Local" tab under "Library", displaying library names as a `ListView` or `GridView`.
   - Implement the "add local library" button within this tab.
   - Consider restructuring existing "Local Tracks" tab for better name alignment.

3. **Behavior Adjustments**
   - Enable track playback to work automatically, considering track source when creating a queue (maintain play from a single library).

4. **Code Adjustments**
   - Ensure the PR targets the `dev` branch instead of the `master` branch.
   - Resolve merge conflicts caused by branch rebasing.

5. **Performance Improvements**
   - Address app freezing and performance issues during local track playback on Windows platforms.

6. **Potential Future Enhancements (Currently Out of Scope)**
   - Consider integrating local track identifiers (e.g., Spotify IDs) in future iterations.
   - Explore album art representation in the UI grid, potentially sourcing from the first few songs' album art.

These instructions target enhancing local library support within the application, improving user experience, and ensuring smoother operation across different system configurations.
