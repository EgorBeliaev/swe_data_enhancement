**Instruction for Changes:**

Implement a fallback mechanism for playing songs when the preferred audio codec is unavailable. Update the logic to automatically use an alternative available codec to ensure the song plays, solving the issue seen with tracks like "Прорицание" by "Fferyllt." This addresses and resolves issue #968 in the repository. Ensure the changes are merged into the correct branch as originally it targeted the master branch by mistake.
