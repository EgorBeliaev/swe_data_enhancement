**Instructions for the Programmer:**

1. **Main Objective**: Improve the Discord RPC by cleaning it up and making the timestamp/timer accurate to the currently playing track.
   
2. **Specific Files/Changes**:
   - Focus on changes in the `discord_provider.dart` file. Remove any unrelated changes from the pull request.
   
3. **Merge Conflict**:
   - Resolve any merge conflicts before proceeding.
   
4. **Additional Notes**:
   - Do not update dependencies unrelated to the PR's main focus unless necessary for building and functionality, such as `win32` dependency update.
   - The addition of recent Discord activity types should be done in a separate PR as per the repository maintainerâ€™s guidance.
   - If desired, the unrelated small change for activity types may be added by KRTirtho after this PR is merged.

**Issue Being Addressed**: This PR resolves inaccuracies in the Discord RPC, specifically aligning the timer with the currently playing track, while addressing the need for cleaner implementation as outlined by the repository maintainers.
