To address the issue in the repository:

### Instructions:
1. **Audio Output Preference:**
   - Update the audio output preference to favor `audiotrack` over `opensles` in the Android configuration by appending an extra comma at the end of the output list, i.e., `"audiotrack,opensles,"`. This change allows `libmpv` to automatically select an available audio output not explicitly listed.

2. **Dependency Management:**
   - Check and update the dependency for `flutter_broadcasts` since there are reported compatibility issues during the project build. Ensure it's correctly fetched from the specified git repository.
  
3. **Version Consistency:**
   - Ensure that the Flutter and Dart versions used across the development environment are consistent. The working versions mentioned are Flutter 3.19.1 and Dart 3.3.0. Verify the setup using FVM (Flutter Version Management).

### Description of the Issue:
This PR aims to fix an Android audio issue that occurs when the screen is off by changing the audio session ID handling and improving audio output management for various devices. It was tested successfully on multiple devices, including Pixel 6a, Pixel 2, Galaxy A01, and others. Additionally, there's a focus on ensuring proper integration of `flutter_broadcasts` in `AndroidPluginRegistrant` to prevent build failures.
