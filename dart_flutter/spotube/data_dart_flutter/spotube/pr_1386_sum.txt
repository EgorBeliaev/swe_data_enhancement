**Instructions for Repository Changes Based on PR Discussion:**

1. **Refactor the Track Matcher:** 
   - Implement a TCP server-based track matcher.

2. **Bug Fixes:**
   - Resolve issues related to automatically skipping tracks (references: #870).
   - Fix track issues such as sticking, stuttering, and lag (references: #580, #1382, #1376, #1348, #1341, #1201).
   - Address weird behavior when re-arranging tracks in the queue (references: #1193, #1267).
   - Improve performance to reduce big track loading delays (reference: #1304).
   - Correct errors related to alternative track source (reference: #1289).
   - Resolve issues with queue track removal not functioning properly (reference: #1092).
   - Fix controls that don't work upon completion of the last track (reference: #924).
   - Address playback issues where downloaded songs sometimes play using the online source (reference: #688).

3. **Playback Mechanism Enhancements:**
   - Ensure the ability to switch between playlists effectively; currently, switching back to a previously played playlist is problematic.
   - Verify the handling of the "currently playing song"; it should not display as empty when there is no song playing.

4. **Testing and Verification:**
   - Ensure the playback tests meet expectations and that no songs get stuck during playback.
   - Verify and resolve any existing issues encountered during testing as mentioned by testers.

By implementing these changes, the repository's playback functionality should improve significantly, and the existing bugs should be addressed.
