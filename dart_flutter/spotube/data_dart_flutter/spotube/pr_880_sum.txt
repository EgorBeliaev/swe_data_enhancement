The issue being addressed by this PR is that on certain Android devices, specifically Xiaomi, forcing high frame rates (HFR) can result in a drop in frames per second (fps). The proposed solution is to filter the device brand using `AndroidDeviceInfo.brand` to prevent this issue. The author suggests that instead of filtering devices, the application should enable high refresh rates by default and then check if the current refresh rate is below 60Hz. If it is, the application will prompt the user to disable high refresh rates. However, to avoid bombarding the user with prompts, the final direction is to implement a failsafe method where the system automatically reverts to the old fps if the target fps is not achieved after enabling HFR.
