The pull request aims to implement a new feature allowing LAN connectivity for remote Spotube playback control across devices on the same network. Here are the detailed changes to be made:

1. **Feature Addition**:
   - Introduce functionality to remotely control Spotube playback on devices within the same local network (LAN), enabling cross-platform compatibility. This includes:
     - Adding remote control capabilities for Spotube on devices running on the same LAN.
     - Implementing a feature to select Bluetooth/other local output devices for playback.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - Ensure the devices intended for control have the "Connect" feature enabled. This can be turned on via the "Settings" menu under "Playback" by selecting "Enable Connect."
   - Develop a user interface on the controller device, such as a smartphone, to navigate to a "Devices" page from the home page. This page should allow users to select and highlight the playing device for remote control access.
   - Implement a control page that appears once the playing device is selected again after highlighting.

3. **Network Requirements**:
   - Ensure all devices involved are connected to the same local Wi-Fi or network (LAN) for the feature to function correctly.

The issue this PR addresses is enabling effective and seamless remote playback control within the same local network, enhancing user experience by allowing device interconnectivity and audio management across different platforms.
