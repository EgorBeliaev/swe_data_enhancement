        "body": "This PR adds JioSaavn as audio source (alternative to YouTube and piped).\r\n\r\n- Has more songs (55 million, spotify has only 40 million) thus more accurate matches are returned\r\n- Lower latency than YouTube or piped as it is a direct official API without any scraping or proxy service\r\n  (Returns JSON directly)\r\n- Up to 320kpbs mp4 (AAC) support, resulting in the same quality of Spotify's official audio\r\n- Less risk of getting banned or rate-limited\r\n- Global availability (expect China)\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Slower download speed as JioSaavn's CDNs are way less spread compared to YouTube's\r\n\r\nAdditional:\r\n- Now, if nothing is found in any of the source each of the source will be used as a fallback source"
