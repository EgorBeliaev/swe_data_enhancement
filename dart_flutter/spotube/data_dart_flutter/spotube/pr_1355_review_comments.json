How should it work?\r\nI have the current version 3.6.0 on Windows, Mac and Android and had thought that I would be able to stream my music to my HiFi Berry or my Sonos sound system from there or control my Mac or Windows PC from my Android. Or have I misunderstood?\r\n\r\n\"Only\" locally connected Bluetooth could be selected among the devices when I connect it to my JBL speaker."

You can turn Connect on from \"Settings\" > \"Playback\" > \"Enable Connect\"\n\nThen on the controller device e.g. your phone, you have to go to the \"Devices\" page  from the home page and select that playing device. Once connected (highlighted) tap once again on that device to go the control page"
