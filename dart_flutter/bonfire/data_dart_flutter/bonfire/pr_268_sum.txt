**Instruction for Programmer:**

Update the `moveOnlyMapArea` limits to reflect changes in the camera's zoom level instead of the map size. Adjust the logic within the relevant function to ensure it updates appropriately with zoom changes, as the map size remains constant. This change addresses issue #267 and should be documented under `[next]` in the `CHANGELOG.md`. Ensure code formatting is consistent with `flutter format`. No breaking changes are introduced with this update.
