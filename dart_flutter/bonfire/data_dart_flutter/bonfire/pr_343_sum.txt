**Instruction for Programmer:**

Improve the keyboard controls functionality to ensure more natural behavior when multiple keys are pressed simultaneously. Incorporate these changes into the `develop` branch. Verify that the changes do not introduce any breaking changes for users and update the `[next]` section in `CHANGELOG.md` with a description of the enhancement. Conduct a format check using `flutter format --set-exit-if-changed --dry-run .` to ensure coding standards are adhered to.
