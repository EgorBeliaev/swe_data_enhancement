**Instruction:**

Modify the tiled asset loader to be more lenient when explicitly specifying the `assets/images/` prefix. This is particularly useful for users utilizing packages like `flutter_gen` to avoid string typos. Ensure no changes required for Flame users' applications, as this is not a breaking change.
