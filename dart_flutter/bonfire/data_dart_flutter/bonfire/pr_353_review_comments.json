        "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you for developing this package and preparing the excellent sample code! \r\n\r\nI just recently started learning game programming in Flutter and am now researching how the game works by analyzing your sample code :)\r\n\r\nWell, I saw that `flutter_lints` was not applied to `example` folder, so I applied it and optimized it. I also modified the typos and other areas that could be modified, but left some of them as they were. \r\n\r\nAfter applying `flutter_lints` to eliminate warnings that have occurred, I check the operation and confirm that each game in the sample works :)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore you create this PR confirm that it meets all requirements listed below by checking the relevant checkboxes (`[x]`). This will ensure a smooth and quick review process.\r\n\r\n- [x] I open this PR to the `develop` branch.\r\n- [ ] I have added a description of the change under `[next]` in `CHANGELOG.md`.\r\n- [x] I ran `flutter format --set-exit-if-changed --dry-run .` and has success.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a fix regarding example, I did not add description to `CHANGELOG`. Please add it if it's needed.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Change\r\n\r\nDoes your PR require Flame users to manually update their apps to accommodate your change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this is a breaking change (please indicate a breaking change in `CHANGELOG.md`).\r\n- [x] No, this is *not* a breaking change."
