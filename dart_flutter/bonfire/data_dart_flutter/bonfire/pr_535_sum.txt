### Instructions for Changes:

1. **Tile Rotation Bugfix**:
   - Replace the existing anchor cheat-fix with proper coordinate adjustments.

2. **Collision Rectangle Rotation Bugfix**:
   - Test with Tiled editor tiles. Verify rotation when the tile is rotated by the "z" key on the keyboard which ensures the collision rectangle rotates correctly.

3. **Revert Change**: 
   - Revert the changes made to `KeyboardActionEvent`. Note the author's suggestion to consider separating logical actions for clarity between custom joysticks and real keyboards, although this is not part of this specific PR.

4. **Ensure Compliance**:
   - The PR is opened against the `develop` branch.
   - `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .` has been run successfully.
   - No need for users to update their applications; this is not a breaking change.

**Optional Task (for future consideration):**
- Consider adding a description of changes under `[next]` in `CHANGELOG.md` for better documentation, as this was not completed in the current PR.
