Add a new game example showcasing multi-scenario handling and the `Sensor` mixin. Ensure no breaking changes are introduced and update the `[next]` section in `CHANGELOG.md`. Open PR to the `develop` branch and verify code formatting with `flutter format`. Note: Flutter 3.7 requires change from `static OverlayState? of(` to `static OverlayState of(`, which can be addressed in a separate PR.
