This PR addresses the alignment and visibility issues in the MiniMap widget when using non-1.0 zoom values:

1. **Visibility Enhancement:**
   - Replace `widget.game.visibles()` with `widget.game.query()` in the MiniMap widget to display all GameComponents, ensuring all components are visible, including those outside of the camera view.

2. **Alignment Correction:**
   - Modify `canvas.translate` logic in the `MiniMapCanvas` class to keep the minimap centered on `cameraPosition`, maintaining alignment between the minimap and the camera position despite zoom adjustments.  

These changes fix issues with off-centered display and incomplete component visibility at zoom levels other than 1.0.
