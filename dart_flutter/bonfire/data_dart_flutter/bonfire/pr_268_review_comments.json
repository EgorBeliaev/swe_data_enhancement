        "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nWhen the BonfireCamera changes his zoom, the moveOnlyMapArea property wasn't updating his limits. I've fixed that in this PR.\r\nWhen the camera zoom changes, the limits are updated too.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the way it was being done, this should be updated when the map size changes, but the map size never changes, only the zoom. I changed the logic of the function that does this to be based on changing the zoom, rather than changing the size of the map.\r\n\r\nThis closes the issue [#267](https://github.com/RafaelBarbosatec/bonfire/issues/267).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I open this PR to the `develop` branch.\r\n- [x] I have added a description of the change under `[next]` in `CHANGELOG.md`.\r\n- [x] I ran `flutter format --set-exit-if-changed --dry-run .` and has success.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this is a breaking change (please indicate a breaking change in `CHANGELOG.md`).\r\n- [x] No, this is *not* a breaking change."
