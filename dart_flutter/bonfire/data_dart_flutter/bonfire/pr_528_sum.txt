Add a guard in the `FlyingAttackGameObject` to prevent the `onDestroy` method from being called after the component has been removed. Additionally, refactor to remove any redundant parameters. Ensure this update is documented under `[next]` in `CHANGELOG.md`. This change is not a breaking change, so no manual updates are required from the users.
