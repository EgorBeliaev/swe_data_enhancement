**Instruction for Programmer:**

Apply `flutter_lints` to the `example` folder to eliminate warnings, optimize the code, and fix any typos. Ensure that the changes do not introduce any breaking changes to the main functionality of the sample games. All games in the sample should function correctly after the linting and optimization. Note that a description of this change has not been added to `CHANGELOG.md` because it pertains only to the examples, and therefore, does not require a mention unless deemed necessary by maintainers. Ensure the PR is opened to the `develop` branch, and that `flutter format --set-exit-if-changed --dry-run .` returns success before final submission.
