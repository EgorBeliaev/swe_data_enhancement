Fix the issue where the character displays the run animation instead of the jump animation when on slanting tiles. Ensure that the character correctly transitions into jump mode in such scenarios. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` under `[next]` to reflect the change, and confirm compatibility with the `develop` branch without needing any manual updates for existing apps.
