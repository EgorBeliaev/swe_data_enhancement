**Instructions:**

In the `MatrixLayer` class, update the constructor to allow setting the `axisInverted` field, which was previously not possible. Ensure that the changes are documented under `[next]` in `CHANGELOG.md`, and verify code formatting with `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .`. This update is non-breaking for existing users.
