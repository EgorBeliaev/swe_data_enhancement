### Instructions for Changes:

1. **Background Blur Implementation:**
   - Add background blur functionality with an initial blur value of 15 (modifiable).

2. **Theme Color Indicator:**
   - Enable theme color indicators.
   - Implement a default color using Material Design 3.
   - Review the current color selection to eliminate nearly indistinguishable colors.
   - Refer to `ColorScheme.fromSeed` constructor for color optimization (Lines 436-453).

3. **Address Memory Usage for `network_img_layer`:**
   - Investigate and fix memory usage issues with `network_img_layer` that significantly increase memory consumption on the Windows platform (over 1GB).
   - Note: Current implementation leads to frequent garbage collection on mobile devices.
   - Inspect the `cached_network_image` source to rectify memory image cropping issues.
   - Review image presentation to ensure size constraints are enforced, possibly due to lack of constraints in `imageBuilder` method.
