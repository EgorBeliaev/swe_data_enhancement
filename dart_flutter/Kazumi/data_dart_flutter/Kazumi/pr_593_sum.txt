### Instructions for Addressing PR Feedback and Improvements

1. **Refactor `loadPlugins` Function:**
   - Consider breaking down the `loadPlugins` function into smaller, more manageable pieces to avoid stacking logic excessively.
   - Ensure function names accurately reflect their purpose and differentiate between similarly named functions like `loadPlugins` and `loadAllPlugins`.

2. **Improve Code Comments:**
   - Increase the number of comments throughout the code, focusing on explaining functions with unclear semantics.
   - Add specific comments in `plugin_controller.dart` detailing changes in storage handling since version 1.5.1, particularly the switch to storing rules in `plugin.json`.

3. **UI Update Handling:**
   - Address the UI update issue by utilizing `pluginList.replaceRange(i, i + 1, [plugin]);` instead of `pluginList[i] = plugin;` for more effective updates.
   - In `plugin_controller.dart` L52, instead of directly assigning values, use `clear` followed by `addAll` to trigger list updates.

4. **Forward Compatibility:**
   - Modify `plugins.json` storage path to ensure backward compatibility. Consider placing it in a subdirectory such as `/plugins/v2` to prevent parsing issues with older versions.
  
5. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality Justification:**
   - Evaluate the need for a "drag & drop" feature compared to the simpler "move to top" functionality, ensuring that the added complexity is justified and improves usability.

Make these changes to address PR feedback and enhance code clarity and functionality.
