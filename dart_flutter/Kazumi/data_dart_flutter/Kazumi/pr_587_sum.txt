### Instructions for Repository Modifications:

1. **Flutter Integration**:
   - Implement Flutter as a submodule for F-Droid builds. Ensure the repository uses the submodule's Flutter for F-Droid compilation.
   - Do not remove the "+1" in the version number as it is necessary for MSIX builds.

2. **Flutter Submodule Positioning**:
   - Move the `.flutter` submodule directory into the `fastlane` directory to avoid confusion, as it only affects F-Droid builds.

3. **Workflow Adjustment**:
   - Consider updating the GitHub Action workflow to use the Flutter submodule for setup, ensuring consistency in APK builds between F-Droid and GitHub Actions. This adjustment may be postponed if deemed necessary.

4. **Documentation Update**:
   - Update any screenshots in the README, especially those linked to F-Droid onboarding.

5. **Signature Management**:
   - Ensure current Android signing configurations are appropriately set in `android/app/build.gradle`.
   - Store signing keys securely, possibly using GitHub Secrets, similar to the practice observed in the `piliapala` project if needed.

6. **Version Update and Release Management**:
   - Hold off on F-Droid Merge Requests until version `1.5.2` to avoid discrepancies in APK signatures between releases.

7. **Issue with F-Droid Builds**:
   - Address issues with APK signing and content mismatch as indicated by log discrepancies.
   - The `.so` file mismatches are expected temporary issues; ensure that `libflutter.so` version alignment is checked post-Flutter version update.

8. **Version Code Alignment**:
   - Adjust the `versionCode` to align with F-Droid's update detection logic, awaiting further input from F-Droid developers.
