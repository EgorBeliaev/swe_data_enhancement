Remove the use of `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` from the comments sheet. This change addresses issues with automatic comment loading on mobile platforms after changing collections. Note that behavior differs across platforms: it does not reload on OHOS, which may indicate an underlying issue elsewhere. Be aware of previous concerns in PR #677 regarding flickering, though the fix for this is implemented in `CustomScrollView`, as noted in comments from ErBWs.
