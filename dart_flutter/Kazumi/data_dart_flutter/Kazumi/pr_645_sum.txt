This GitHub PR discussion pertains to a fix for the player panel functionality. The primary changes and instructions to be made are:

1. **Branch Strategy:**
   - Evaluate if creating a development branch that merges into the main for updates is necessary given there are no pre-releases or cherry-pick functionalities.

2. **Double-tap Gesture Behavior:**
   - Align the double-tap behavior with Bilibili (B站)'s UX design:
     - Remove any effects on the control panel display when double-tapping during play or pause.
     - Double-tap should only toggle play/pause without affecting the visibility of the control panel.

3. **Screen Lock and Gestures:**
   - During screen lock, do not register double-tap callbacks.
   - Adjust the gesture for fast forward/rewind:
     - Horizontal swipe will display the control panel.
     - On swipe completion, either hide the panel or reset the hide timer based on the initial panel state, in line with Bilibili’s approach.

These updates ensure the player panel UI/UX aligns closely with the more professionally designed Bilibili platform.
