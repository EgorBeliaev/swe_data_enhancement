**Instruction Summary for PR:**

1. **Fix Collect Button Size on Mobile:**
   - Address an issue where the collect button background is larger than the icon on mobile devices. This is a mobile-specific bug that needs to be corrected.

2. **Dynamic Color Persistence Issue:**
   - Note a problem where `setDynamicColor` does not update `hive` with `themeColor` when dynamic color is enabled, affecting reloading of the app with dynamic colors.

3. **Impact of Dynamic Color on Theme Switching:**
   - Be aware that enabling dynamic color disables custom color themes. Investigate why Android dynamic color retrieval is incorrect.

4. **Interim Solution:**
   - Modify only the button for now while deferring dynamic color study. Consider storing dark/light `ThemeData` instead of direct colors to achieve persistence without altering the storage structure.

5. **Examine Dynamic Color Implementation:**
   - Review the Android part of `dynamic_color` to understand the core issue affecting dynamic color functionality.
