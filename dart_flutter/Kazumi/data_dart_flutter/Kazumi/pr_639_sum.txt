This PR aims to fix an issue with the player panel where consuming outside taps causes unintended video pauses or plays due to panel hiding when the menu is open. The proposed solution involves setting `consumeOutsideTap: true` to address these unintended behaviors. Additionally, one idea is to modify `videoPageController` to include a boolean flag to control whether the panel is allowed to close, as attempts to cancel `hideTimer` are ineffective due to the `handleHover` function still causing the panel to hide.
