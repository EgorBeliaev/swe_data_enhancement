The issue in the repository is related to the non-reproducibility of the libmpv Android builds when using different build environments such as F-Droid and GitHub Actions. The build artifacts, particularly the .jar and .so files, have inconsistent MD5 checksums across these environments, leading to the issue of non-deterministic builds.

**Instructions for resolving the issue:**

1. **NDK Version Update:**
   - Ensure that the libmpv build uses NDK version r27c, consistent with the main repository configuration.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Dependencies:**
   - Eliminate Flutter dependency from the libmpv workflow to reduce discrepancies between different build environments.

3. **Handle Build Parameters:**
   - Pass specific compilation parameters to the mbedtls build process to enable necessary instruction sets while ensuring no adverse effects on other architectures.

4. **Stabilize JAR Metadata:**
   - Use the `strip-nondeterminism` tool to eliminate zip metadata discrepancies in the .jar files.

5. **Check Build ID and Timestamps:**
   - Modify build configurations to ensure that build dates and build IDs are not inconsistently embedded in the build artifacts.

6. **Handle Pipelines and Dependencies:**
   - Review F-Droid pipeline logs; ensure consistent Gradle versions between builds.
   - Investigate any discrepancies in additional build scripts like `download-sdk.sh` as they may affect package differences.

7. **Ensure Environment Consistency:**
   - Use Debian environment where necessary to align with differences found in Meson versions or other build tools.
   - Consider using the `container: docker.io/debian:bookworm-slim` option for consistent environments in GitHub Actions.

8. **Export Intermediate Artifacts:**
   - Configure pipeline export settings to capture and compare intermediate build artifacts to identify where differences occur between builds.

By following these steps, the build process should become more consistent across different environments, ultimately achieving reproducible builds.
