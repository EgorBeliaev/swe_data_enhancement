**Condensed Instructions:**

1. Implement a "forward" feature that advances playback by a specified number of seconds, defaulting to 80s for skipping intros (OP) and outros (ED) in anime episodes.
2. Allow users to long-press the forward button to customize the skip duration, which should reset to 80s when switching to a different series.
3. Store the forward feature setting in the `playerController` to maintain settings across episodes within the same series.
4. Replace the current icon with `fast_forward` from the `material icons` library, ensuring it is visually appealing.
5. Add a tooltip to the forward button explaining that users can long-press to adjust the skip time.
6. Ensure the text field for inputting custom skip times accepts only numeric input and replace `ProgressBar` seek logic with `playerController.seek`.
7. Remove the `isInt` utility function and instead use `int.tryParse(input)!=null` for input validation, aligning with best practices found elsewhere in the codebase.

These instructions capture the main changes discussed in the PR review, focusing on the introduction and customization of the forward feature, UI enhancements, and code optimization practices.
