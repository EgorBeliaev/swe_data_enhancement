This PR addresses two main issues in the repository:

1. **Fullscreen Menu Width on Desktop**: The selection menu width is incorrectly set to the screen height when in fullscreen mode on desktop, making it excessively wide.

2. **Comments Section Scrolling Problem Due to Lazy Loading**: There is an issue with scrolling in the comments section triggered by lazy loading, particularly noticeable when switching episodes.

### Instructions for changes:

- Adjust the menu width calculation logic to avoid setting it to the screen height when in fullscreen mode on desktop.
- Ensure that the comments section properly handles loading without clearing the comments array, thus preventing unnecessary reloads.
  
   Specifically:
   - Implement checks to ensure comments are only reloaded when necessary (i.e., when episode switching occurs).
   - Address occasional locking of the comment section to the previous episode when switching between animations before the video resource is fully loaded.
   - Investigate and fix the potential misuse of `episodeID` during episode switches, which may lead to stale information being displayed in the comments.

Please note the suggestion to merge the width adjustment fix first, while the scrolling issue requires further investigation for a complete resolution.
