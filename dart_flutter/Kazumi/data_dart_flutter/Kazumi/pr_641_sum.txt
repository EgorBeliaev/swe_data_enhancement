The changes to be made for the 'optimize panel hide logic' PR are as follows:

1. **Timer Cancellation Logic**:
   - Ensure that timers initiated when the mouse enters non-panel areas are canceled effectively when transitioning directly to the panel area. This is to prevent the panel from hiding unexpectedly when the mouse rests over it.

2. **Event Handling**:
   - Update the `lib/pages/player/player_item.dart` to differentiate more clearly between the `onHover` events occurring in player items and the panel itself. This differentiation is meant to address the issue where simultaneous mouse events cause confusion leading to unexpected panel hiding/display behavior.

3. **Direct Panel Entry**:
   - Modify the `onEnter` and `onHover` functionalities within the panel's logic to ensure that entering the panel area directly from outside the screen allows the panel to display without triggering any hide timers. This will fix the issue where the panel doesn't display as expected upon such entry.

These changes address issues related to panel visibility under specific mouse movement conditions and improve the overall user interaction experience with the panel component.
