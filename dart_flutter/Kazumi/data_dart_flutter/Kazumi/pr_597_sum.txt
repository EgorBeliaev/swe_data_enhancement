### Instructions for PR Changes:

1. **Volume Adjustment Behavior:**
   - Ensure that the behavior for volume adjustment is consistent across platforms. Specifically, the PR should not initialize the volume adjustment from 100% on mobile platforms as it directly controls system volume, which is unacceptable.

2. **`curVolume` Usage:**
   - Re-evaluate the necessity of the `curVolume` variable. It appears that existing `volume` can be used directly in all scenarios where `curVolume` is currently utilized.

3. **Line 135 Modification:**
   - Update the code at Line 135 to return 100 when `volume` is -1. 
   - Remove the `playerVolume` getter usage and replace it with a direct assignment of 100 to reduce computational overhead.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the changes on both Android and Windows platforms to ensure they work as expected.

### Issue Identification:

- This PR is intended to address inconsistencies in how volume settings are persisted or adjusted across different platforms, ensuring harmony and predictability in user experience concerning volume control. Additionally, it aims to streamline and optimize the code to avoid unnecessary complexity and computational costs.
