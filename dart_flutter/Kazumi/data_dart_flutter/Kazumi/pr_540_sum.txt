**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Code Simplification:**
   - **Remove Conditional Check:**
     Replace the following code:
     ```dart
     if (AnimeSeason(timelineController.selectedDate).toString() == AnimeSeason(DateTime.now()).toString()) {
       await timelineController.getSchedules();
     } else {
       await timelineController.getSchedulesBySeason();
     }
     ```
     with:
     ```dart
     await timelineController.getSchedulesBySeason();
     ```
     Note: Be cautious about removing this, as there are concerns about using a specific API for the current season.

2. **Button Logic Adjustment:**
   - **Remove Unused Button Logic:**
     The PR removes the onPress function for a button that compared `timelineController.selectedDate` with `generateDateTime(i, selectedSeason)`. This was a 'current-state' button that, when pressed, did nothing.

3. **Retain Schedule Retrieval:**
   - Ensure that the `timelineController.getSchedules();` call is not inadvertently removed or its functionality disrupted in other parts of the project.

Verify that the removal of the button's onPress logic does not impact the navigation or data retrieval functionality, particularly the ability to retrieve data using `timelineController.getSchedules()` when selecting future dates like 2024ç§‹.

**Repository Issue:**

The primary issue being addressed is the simplification of time-related code, specifically how schedules are retrieved based on whether the current quarter matches the selected date. Considerations include maintaining correct API usage for seasonal data retrieval to ensure no loss of required functionalities.
