This pull request primarily addresses issues with the player panel and system navigation bar handling in the specified repository. Here are the instructions and observations extracted from the discussion:

1. **Player Item State Management:**
   - Investigate the use of `setState` in `player_item.dart` as `playerController.danmakuOn` already uses mobX with an `@observer` annotation. Consider wrapping relevant sections with an `Observer` to trigger UI refreshes correctly.

2. **Build Widget Structure:**
   - Ensure the `Observer` wraps child widgets, particularly `Widget danmakuTextField()`, to maintain timely updates. Consider adjusting this to `Widget get danmakuTextField` for organizational clarity.
   - Address focus handling issues with `danmakuTextField`, as the focus remains captured after initial input, causing the soft keyboard to appear unexpectedly.

3. **Icon Display Consistency:**
   - Investigate the behavior of the danmaku switch `Icon`, noting its unexpected similarity to `textfield` focus issues, although it isn't a split child widget.

4. **Positioning and Layout Adjustments:**
   - Due to changes in `video_page` with `Positioned`, ensure that tapping the `TextField` moves the panel above the phone's keyboard to prevent blockage. Review current mobile sizing, ensuring the grid view in `menuBody` isn't too narrow at 420 width; consider using a single column or previous width settings.

5. **Known Resolved Aspects:**
   - The width and keyboard overlay issues on mobile are pinpointed for future discussions, indicating they may not be fully resolved within this PR's scope.

By addressing these specific details, the PR aims to ensure the player panel integrates seamlessly with system navigation, focusing on state management, UI refresh, and layout considerations.
