Implement a hero transition effect for the bangumi image as it switches on the info page. Note that if part of the image is hidden, the transition may not display optimally. The existing `makeHeroTag` utility function in `Utils` can be utilized, ensuring that `transitionOnUserGestures` is set to enable functionality in a modular setup. Address any animation clipping issues in future optimizations.
