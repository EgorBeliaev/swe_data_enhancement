The PR discussion revolves around addressing a search functionality issue. The problem identified involves inconsistent logic in how search results are accessedâ€”specifically, transitioning from using `searchKeyword` to `bangumi.name`, which may not be the expected behavior. After consideration, it is agreed to merge the PR, acknowledging a need to reevaluate this approach in the future. The changes aim to ensure that when there is a search keyword, it should be used for indexing; otherwise, `bangumi.name` should be the fallback. The instruction to a programmer familiar with the repository would be:

**Instruction**: 
Ensure search functionality uses `searchKeyword` when available, and defaults to `bangumi.name` in its absence. Review the transition behavior to confirm it meets expected logic standards and revisit for potential optimizations if necessary. Merge as advised, but keep an eye on user feedback for further refinements.
