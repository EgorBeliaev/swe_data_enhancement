1. **Code Optimization**: 
   - Integrate multiple `PopupMenuItem` constants into a `for` loop to reduce code volume. Ensure that the change does not affect code readability negatively.

2. **Tooltip Handling**:
   - Do not display tooltips for the components, as the component is reused in various contexts where tooltips may not be suitable, such as history cards.
   - Consider if adding `collectType` values is necessary for understanding the icon functionality without tooltips, as the original choice might have been design-driven.

3. **Icon Placement**:
   - Address the issue where collect_button icons may obstruct the title names of episodes. Experiment with relocating the widget, potentially moving related widgets into a row layout.
   - Consider updating the collect_button icon to resemble the aesthetic of the delete history record icon if it provides a more visually appealing result.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Merge the PR and subsequently evaluate the impact of stacking the button on the card, originally implemented to solve an unspecified issue. Further adjustments may be considered post-merge.
