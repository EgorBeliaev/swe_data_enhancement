### Condensed Instructions for PR Changes:

1. **Add "Do Not Ask Again" Option:**
   - Implement a "Do Not Ask Again" checkbox on the close page for desktop platforms.
   - This option should be configurable in settings at a later stage.

2. **Code Adjustments:**
   - **Default Values:** In `lib/bean/appbar/sys_app_bar.dartL43`, ensure `setting.get` has a default value consistent with other project implementations.
   - **Dialog Management:** Refactor `lib/pages/my/my_page.dartL147` to utilize `KazumiDialog.dismiss()` for dialog management, aligning with project standards.
   - **Null Checks:** In `lib/pages/my/my_page.dartL144`, consider checking for null values instead of using assertions for safety.

3. **Desktop Platform Specific Code:**
   - Add condition `if (Utils.isDesktop)` to ensure new features are only available on desktop.
   - Wrap the following features in the SettingsSection with this condition for desktops.

4. **Settings Placement:**
   - Move the new option into the `about_page` as a standalone `SettingsSection`.

5. **Final Review:**
   - Ensure that the latest modifications (wrapping SettingsSection) are in place before merging.
   - Await final confirmations from all reviewers before proceeding with the merge.
