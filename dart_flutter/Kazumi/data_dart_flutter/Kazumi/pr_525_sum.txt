**Issue Description**:  
The issue being addressed in this pull request is that after performing a search, the `searchKeyword` does not reset upon exiting the search. This behavior causes issues when clicking on a card, as it continues to use the previous `searchKeyword`.

**Proposed Solution**:  
The fix involves ensuring that the `searchKeyword` is properly reset after a search is exited. The code modification is specifically in `bangumi_card.dart` where the logic checks if `popularController.searchKeyword` is an empty string. If true, it assigns the `bangumiItem`'s name or its alternative name to `popularController.keyword`. Otherwise, it uses `popularController.searchKeyword` directly.

The code snippet provided indicates this logic:
```dart
if (popularController.searchKeyword == '') {
  popularController.keyword = bangumiItem.nameCn == ''
      ? bangumiItem.name
      : (bangumiItem.nameCn);
} else {
  popularController.keyword = popularController.searchKeyword;
}
```

**Additional Context**:  
It was suggested in the discussion that this logic might be replaced by a setter, but it was later clarified that there was a misunderstanding, and the current solution in the PR is considered correct and sufficient.
