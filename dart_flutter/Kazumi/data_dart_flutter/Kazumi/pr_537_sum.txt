This PR addresses modifications and potential improvements to the settings UI in the repository:

1. **Obsolete Components and Files**: 
   - Some components and routes have been identified as unused and suggestions have been made for removal. These include:
     - `lib/bean/settings/settings.dart` specifically `SelectDialog`.
     - `lib/pages/settings/danmaku/danmaku_source_settings.dart`
     - `lib/pages/settings/other_settings.dart`
   - Consider confirming their redundancy and removing them completely from the repository if not needed.

2. **File and Route Management**:
   - Directly remove unused files, as they can be recovered later through Git if needed.
   - Check and correct the route for the mirror settings button provided in the rules store, as it seems to have issues.

3. **User Interface Adjustments**:
   - Increase the maximum width from 800 to 1000 pixels for better display on current forms.
   - Implement dynamic width adjustment based on `mediaQuery.width` to ensure optimal display across different screen sizes.

4. **UI Design Update**:
   - Follow MD3 guidelines by using Outlined borders on interfaces containing many `TextField` elements. Consider whether this design change is necessary before submitting.

5. **Technical Fix**:
   - Address the Git mirror issue where the refresh button does not retrieve new key values. Investigate the underlying cause and implement a fix.
