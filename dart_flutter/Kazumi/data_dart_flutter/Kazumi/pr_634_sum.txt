Title: Refactor PC Player Panel

- Refactor the PC interface; focus is on PC side for now, multi-platform adaptation will be worked on later.
- Consider creating a separate `player_item_panel.dart` for mobile interfaces.
- Replace `PopUpMenuButton` with `MenuAnchor` as recommended in Flutter's documentation; however, note that it may lack animations due to a Flutter issue ([#143781](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/143781)), workarounds are possible with `AnimationController`.
- Fix the issue where default enabling of danmaku (bullet chats) is broken; check if any setting keys have been mistakenly deleted.
- Modify error: Allow danmaku to be sent only after the player has finished loading on mobile devices; prevent sending during parsing process to avoid issues.
- Check and address MenuAnchor-related issues:
  1. MenuAnchor moves with the player control panelâ€™s hide animation and unexpectedly moves off-screen.
  2. Clicking elsewhere when a menu is open currently pauses the player; fix this behavior.
- Ensure visual design cohesion by using MenuAnchor, supporting two-tier menus especially for mobile, noting that PopUpMenuButton might not align with Material 3 guidelines.
- Review prompt for danmaku input; originally mirrored from a video site B-Station, consider options to display random prompts if possible.
- Finalize decision on whether to display toast upon successful danmaku sending, currently it obstructs the panel and may be removed.
- Detailed review and testing will continue locally due to PR size and complexity.

Note: Visual fixes and testing required based on given feedback and provided screenshots.
