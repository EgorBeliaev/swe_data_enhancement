### Instructions for Setting Up F-Droid Repository Workflow:

1. **Create New Repository**: Initiate a new GitHub repository named `flclash-fdroid-repo`.

2. **Configure SSH Deploy Keys**: Set up SSH deploy keys for both repositories following [this guide](https://cpina.github.io/push-to-another-repository-docs/setup-using-ssh-deploy-keys.html#setup-ssh-deploy-keys). Ensure the private key does not contain line breaks.

3. **Generate Android Signing Key**: Create an Android signing key for the F-Droid repository (not the application).

4. **Set Actions Secrets**: In the `flclash-droid-repo` repository, use the generated key data to configure the following GitHub Actions Secrets:
   - `KEY_ALIAS`
   - `STORE_PASSWORD`
   - `KEY_PASSWORD`
   - `KEY_DNAME` (Example: `CN=Unknown, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown`)
   - `KEYSTORE`

5. **Coordinate with F-Droid Repository**: Wait for the submission and merge of a pull request in the fdroid repository.

6. **Create New Branch**: From the main branch, create a new branch named `action-pr`.

7. **Run Deploy Action**: Manually trigger the `deploy` action if it doesn’t run automatically, and wait for its completion.

8. **Configure GitHub Pages**: Go to the repository settings, navigate to `Pages`, set the source to 'Deploy from a branch', select the `gh-pages` branch, and save.

9. **Access F-Droid Repository URL**: Visit [this link](https://chen08209.github.io/flclash-fdroid-repo/repo), copy the central link URL, and extract the fingerprint.

10. **Update README Fingerprints**: Replace the `FINGERPRINT` fields in two places within both READMEs of the fdroid repository. The PR initiator will modify the appropriate README’s `FINGERPRINT` field in this PR.

11. **Merge the Pull Request**: After all changes, merge this pull request to finalize the setup.
