**Instructions for Programmer:**

1. **Fix Category Loading**:
   - Ensure the correct loading of categories on the main screen. This includes fixing the issue where video categories and chart/global music are not displaying correctly.

2. **Refactor PageController Handling**:
   - Address the conflict issue when multiple PageControllers are used on the same page. The error "The page property cannot be read when multiple PageViews are attached to the same PageController" arises because the default controller is shared.
   - Implement a solution to decentralize PageController usage by creating page controllers within widgets to avoid shared state conflicts, adhering to the error message reported from `flutter/src/widgets/page_view.dart`. 

These instructions focus on correcting the functional and structural errors outlined by the discussed PR.
