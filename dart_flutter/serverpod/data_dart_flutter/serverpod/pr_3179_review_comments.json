        "body": "**Description:**  \r\nThis refactor standardizes the use of the `moduleAlias` field by consolidating it within the `TypeDefinition` structure. The `moduleAlias` field, which was already present, has been updated with additional checks and logic to improve its functionality across the codebase. The field has been removed from all other definitions to simplify and centralize its usage.  \r\n\r\n**Changes include:**  \r\n- Consolidated the `moduleAlias` field into `TypeDefinition`.  \r\n- Updated the `moduleAlias` getter to include new checks:\r\n  - Added conditions to handle `_projectRef` and `_packageRef` prefixes.  \r\n- Removed `moduleAlias` from all other related definitions.  \r\n- Updated relevant references and usages to align with the new structure.  \r\n\r\n**Why this change?**  \r\n- Ensures a single source of truth for the `moduleAlias` field.  \r\n- Improves code maintainability and reduces redundancy.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCloses: #3131\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contribute](https://docs.serverpod.dev/contribute) page and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] This update contains only one single feature or bug fix and nothing else.
