The PR addresses the issue where `LocalCache` incorrectly returns `null` for expired keys instead of invoking the `cacheMissHandler`. The changes ensure that only one `cacheMissHandler` for a given key is invoked at any time, and they won't be called in parallel for the same key. All `get` operations for the same key will resolve to the same value or error. There are minor suggestions provided for test clean-up, but no specific details are included. The overall feedback is positive, indicating that the necessary changes have improved the handling of cache misses.
