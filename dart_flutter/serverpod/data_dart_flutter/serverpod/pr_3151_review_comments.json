        "body": "### Description:\r\nThis PR addresses an issue where enums with a value named `name` caused conflicts in string representation, serialization, and deserialization. The changes ensure compatibility and correctness for such enums across all relevant methods.\r\n\r\n#### Changes:\r\n- Updated the code generator to handle enums with values named `name` correctly.\r\n- Prevented conflicts arising from enums with values named `name` by explicitly referencing the built-in `Enum.name` property.\r\n\r\n   \r\nCloses: #3072\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contribute](https://docs.serverpod.dev/contribute) page and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] This update contains only one single feature or bug fix and nothing else.
