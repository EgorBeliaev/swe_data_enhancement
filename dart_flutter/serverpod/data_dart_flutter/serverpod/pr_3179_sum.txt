Refactor the codebase to consolidate the `moduleAlias` field exclusively within the `TypeDefinition` structure. Implement additional checks in the `moduleAlias` getter to handle `_projectRef` and `_packageRef` prefixes. Remove `moduleAlias` occurrences from all other related definitions and update all relevant references and usages to be consistent with this new centralized structure. Ensure all changes align with the goal of having a single source of truth for `moduleAlias`, thus enhancing maintainability and reducing redundancy.
