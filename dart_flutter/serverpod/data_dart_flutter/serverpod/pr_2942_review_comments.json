        "body": "## Description\r\n- Closes #2941 \r\n- Enables logging for run mode `test`. This is not a very nice and sustainable solution, but there are no good solution with a reasonable effort I think. Please let me know if you think there is a better way to solve this.\r\n- Fixes a bug where sessions weren't closed if an exception was thrown in future returning endpoints\r\n- Fixes a bug where sessions weren't closed for any case in stream returning endpoints\r\n\r\nNB: All sessions _were_ closed in the test frameworks' `tearDownAll`, but this is too late for the test user to make any assertions.\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contribute](https://docs.serverpod.dev/contribute) page and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] This update contains only one single feature or bug fix and nothing else. (If you are submitting multiple fixes, please make multiple PRs.)\r\n- [x] I read and followed the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) and formatted the code with [dart format](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format).\r\n- [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`), and made sure that the documentation follows the same style as other Serverpod documentation. I checked spelling and grammar.\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making.\r\n- [x] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n- [x] Any breaking changes are documented below."
