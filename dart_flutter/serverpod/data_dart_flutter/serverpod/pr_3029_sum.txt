**Instruction for Repository Update:**

1. **Remove Server-Initiated WebSocket Closures:**
   - Eliminate the server's capability to close WebSocket connections when no open method stream connections are detected.
   - Ensure that the client has control over the lifecycle of WebSockets.

2. **Retain Server Closure Capability:**
   - Maintain the server's ability to close method streaming connections when a streaming endpoint has completed execution, without closing the WebSocket.

3. **Update Tests:**
   - Remove tests validating server-initiated WebSocket closures.
   - Modify tests to use the session object or a StreamController to validate the return of streaming endpoints instead of relying on WebSocket closure.

4. **Checklist Adherence:**
   - Ensure adherence to project contribution guidelines, Dart Style Guide, and formatting rules.

5. **Document and Test:**
   - Update or add relevant documentation and tests to align with changes made.
   - Verify that all existing and new tests pass without issues.

No breaking changes are expected, as client-managed WebSocket closures were already standard practice.
