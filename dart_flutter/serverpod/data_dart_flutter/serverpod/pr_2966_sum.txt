### Instructions for the Programmer

1. **Direct Model Import Changes:**
   - **File:** `protocol.dart`
     - Remove the self-dependency by importing models directly from their file paths.

   - **Model Files:**
     - Import models directly from their file path rather than using the generated dependency towards `protocol.dart`.

2. **General PR Guidelines:**
   - Follow a commit-by-commit review approach to isolate different changes and tests.
   - Ensure that changes align with the process outlined on the [Contribute page](https://docs.serverpod.dev/contribute).
   - Maintain adherence to the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) and format the code using [dart format](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format).

3. **Documentation and Testing:**
   - Update or add relevant documentation with `///` comments ensuring consistency with existing Serverpod documentation styles.
   - Verify and ensure all new tests are added to check the changes.
   - Confirm that both existing and new tests pass without errors.

4. **Breaking Changes:**
   - Note that there are no breaking changes related to user import patterns.

This PR primarily addresses the simplification of model imports by directly referencing file paths, thus eliminating redundant dependencies.
