**Instruction for Changes:**

- Implement a stricter validation to ensure that the `projectModelDefinition` field is only assigned to models part of the project.
- Address an issue where class name collision with a Serverpod model could result in generating an invalid reference.
- Specifically, observed issue where a project with a `Filter` model caused Serverpod definitions of `filter` model to load incorrectly, assigning the wrong value to `projectModelDefinition`.
- Ensure changes are applied to the `Stable-2.2` branch.
- Reference related issue: [#3019](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/issues/3019) for similar problems in other areas.
- Ensure pre-launch checklist has items executed, such as format adherence and test validations.
- No breaking changes are introduced with this fix.

**Checklist:**
- Follow Dart's style guide and use `dart format`.
- Add relevant documentation and ensure compliance with existing documentation style.
- Add new tests to cover implemented changes.
- Confirm that all tests, both existing and new, pass successfully.
