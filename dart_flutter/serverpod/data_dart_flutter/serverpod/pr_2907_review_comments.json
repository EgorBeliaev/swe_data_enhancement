        "body": "## Description\r\nCloses #2895 .\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes another issue related to emulated nested transaction in the test tools. When an error is raised inside a transaction, the transaction is no longer valid. Therefore the test tools needs to rollback before the error happened but still re-throw it out to the code under test.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR introduces a synchronized lock to enable code like this:\r\n```dart\r\ntest(\r\n    'when creating multiple SimpleData in parallel '\r\n    'then should have inserted all', () async {\r\n  await Future.wait([\r\n    SimpleData.db.insertRow(\r\n      session,\r\n      SimpleData(num: 1),\r\n    ),\r\n    SimpleData.db.insertRow(\r\n      session,\r\n      SimpleData(num: 2),\r\n    ),\r\n    SimpleData.db.insertRow(\r\n      session,\r\n      SimpleData(num: 3),\r\n    ),\r\n  ]);\r\n\r\n  var simpleDatas = await SimpleData.db.find(session);\r\n\r\n  expect(simpleDatas, hasLength(3));\r\n  expect(simpleDatas.map((s) => s.num), containsAll([1, 2, 3]));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor rollbacks to work, there can never be more than a single operation that can fail going on at a single time. Therefore the test database proxy only allows a single database operation at a time. \r\n\r\nAs soon as the user enters a concurrent mode which is not supported by this approach, an exception is thrown. These cases are:\r\n- Concurrent transaction calls (already threw exception before this change)\r\n- Non-transaction call concurrently happening during an ongoing transaction\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Add synchronized lock to database operations in the database test proxy\r\n- Add additional checks for invalid concurrent states that the test tools can't handle\r\n- Unrelated fix to the issue, but this PR also releases save points when they are not needed anymore\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contribute](https://docs.serverpod.dev/contribute) page and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] This update contains only one single feature or bug fix and nothing else. (If you are submitting multiple fixes, please make multiple PRs.)\r\n- [x] I read and followed the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) and formatted the code with [dart format](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format).\r\n- [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`), and made sure that the documentation follows the same style as other Serverpod documentation. I checked spelling and grammar.\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making.\r\n- [x] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n- [x] Any breaking changes are documented below."
