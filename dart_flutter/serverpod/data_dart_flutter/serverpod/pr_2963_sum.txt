### Changes to be implemented:

1. **Remove Unused Code**: Eliminate any unused watch-related code within the endpoint analyzer.
   
2. **Referencing**: Implement relative references for endpoint references within the generated code.

3. **Simplify Endpoint Definitions**: Remove the redundant `subDirParts` field from endpoint definitions.
   
4. **Filter Non-Endpoint Files**: Ensure that the endpoint analyzer filters out files unrelated to endpoints before reporting Dart errors.

### Clarified Objective:

- The aim is to support endpoint definitions located anywhere within the project structure, thus improving endpoint analyzer functionality.

### Compliance:

- The implementation should ensure that no breaking changes occur, maintaining the intended behavior of the system.
