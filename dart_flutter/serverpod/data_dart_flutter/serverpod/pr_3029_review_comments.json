        "body": "Closes: #2952\r\n\r\nThe Serverpod streaming protocol supported closing the connection from the Server side if no open method stram connections were detected. However, this made it impossible for the client to synchronize its state since a connection might have been established and closed from the Server while the client was waiting for input.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the server's possibility to close the WebSocket connections and makes the client authoritative around the lifecycle of WebSockets.\r\n\r\nNote that the server can still close method streaming connections, for example, when a streaming endpoint has returned. It is simply not allowed to close the WebSocket connection as a result of this.\r\n\r\n#### Test fixes\r\n\r\nSome tests were removed as they validated the server's possibility of closing WebSocket connections. Other tests used the closing of the WebSocket connection to indicate that the streaming endpoint had returned.\r\n\r\nThese tests are now modified to rely on the session object or a StreamController, depending on what suited the test case best,  in the endpoint to provide that validation.\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] I read the [Contribute](https://docs.serverpod.dev/contribute) page and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [ ] This update contains only one single feature or bug fix and nothing else. (If you are submitting multiple fixes, please make multiple PRs.)\r\n- [ ] I read and followed the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) and formatted the code with [dart format](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format).\r\n- [ ] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [ ] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`), and made sure that the documentation follows the same style as other Serverpod documentation. I checked spelling and grammar.\r\n- [ ] I added new tests to check the change I am making.\r\n- [ ] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n- [ ] Any breaking changes are documented below.\r\n\r\nIf you need help, consider asking for advice on the [discussion board](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/discussions).\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\nNone - Client always closed WebSocket connections as well. Allowing the server to also close the connection was simply redundant."
