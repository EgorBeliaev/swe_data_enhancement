        "body": "### Description\r\nThis PR introduces validation to ensure that relations with the `serverOnly` scope are explicitly marked as optional. Without this validation, the analyzer fails to detect invalid model definitions, leading to runtime exceptions during deserialization.\r\n\r\nPreviously, if a relation with the `serverOnly` scope was not marked as optional, the generated `fromJson` method would expect the foreign key column to be present, even though it is absent in the client model. This mismatch caused runtime errors when the class was passed as a parameter to an endpoint.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n**Invalid Definition:**\r\n```yaml\r\nclass: Example\r\ntable: example\r\nfields:\r\n  name: String\r\n  user: User?, relation, scope=serverOnly\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Valid Definition:**\r\n```yaml\r\nclass: Example\r\ntable: example\r\nfields:\r\n  name: String\r\n  user: User?, relation(optional), scope=serverOnly\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses: #3104 \r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contribute](https://docs.serverpod.dev/contribute) page and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] This update contains only one single feature or bug fix and nothing else.

I checked spelling and grammar.\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making.\r\n- [x] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n- [x] Any breaking changes are documented below.\r\n\r\nIf you need help, consider asking for advice on the [discussion board](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/discussions).\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n_If you have done any breaking changes, make sure to outline them here, so that they can be included in the notes for the next release._"
