**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Fix Inheritance Bug**: Address the bug where the model inheritance experimental feature generates invalid code when base class fields have default values. Ensure that the generated constructor correctly delegates the initialization of these fields to the superclass, rather than treating them as if they belong to the derived class itself.

2. **Testing**: Add models to the test project to validate this scenario:
   - Include a parent and a child model with configurations identical to those in server and client tests. Ensure that this setup catches edge cases.

Make sure all tests pass after implementing the changes, and document the testing process adequately to maintain consistency with Serverpod's documentation style.
