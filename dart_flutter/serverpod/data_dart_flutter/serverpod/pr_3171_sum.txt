Ensure that relations with the `serverOnly` scope in your model definitions are marked as optional to prevent runtime errors during deserialization. Adjust any model classes like `Example` to include `(optional)` in the relation field definition when it uses `scope=serverOnly`. This change addresses an issue where the `fromJson` method expected absent foreign key columns in the client model, causing errors. This is in reference to issue #3104.
