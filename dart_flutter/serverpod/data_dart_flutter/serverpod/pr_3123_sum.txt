### Instructions for PR Implementation

1. **Enum Resolution & Object Relation Resolution Update:**
   - Add `moduleAlias` checks to ensure enums and object relations with the same `className` in different modules are uniquely identified.
   - Code Reference:
     - Enum: `entity_dependency_resolver.dart` Lines 96-97
     - Object Relation: `entity_dependency_resolver.dart` Lines 116-117

2. **No Change Required:**
   - Inheritance Resolution: No module alias change needed as inheritance across modules is disallowed.
   - List Relation Resolution: List relations on modules are already validated and no modification needed.
   - Extra Class Restrictions, Custom Type Check, and Type Parsing for Extras: Existing logic suffices; no changes needed.

### Additional Notes
- This PR closes issue #3019.
- Follow the pre-launch checklist to ensure the code adheres to the contribution and style guidelines. Ensure all new tests are added and existing tests pass.
