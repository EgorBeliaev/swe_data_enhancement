        "body": "Closes: #3075 \r\n\r\nTyped database exceptions were recently introduced, but they did not correctly inherit the `toString` method defined in the base class.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that by using `base` class and extending the class rather than implementing it.\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] I read the [Contribute](https://docs.serverpod.dev/contribute) page and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [ ] This update contains only one single feature or bug fix and nothing else. (If you are submitting multiple fixes, please make multiple PRs.)\r\n- [ ] I read and followed the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) and formatted the code with [dart format](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format).\r\n- [ ] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [ ] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`), and made sure that the documentation follows the same style as other Serverpod documentation. I checked spelling and grammar.\r\n- [ ] I added new tests to check the change I am making.\r\n- [ ] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n- [ ] Any breaking changes are documented below.\r\n\r\nIf you need help, consider asking for advice on the [discussion board](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/discussions).\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\nNone - the class should not be implemented by users outside of the library."
