This pull request introduces a change to address an issue in a cloud environment where streams occasionally drop the last packets due to a potential data race between the subscription cancel call and `onData` processing. 

**Changes:**
- Introduce an end-of-stream message to ensure the buffer is completely processed before cancellation.
- Pass this message as an error to avoid branching in the stream's "hot path."
- Remove awaits from the `listen` callback to prevent new messages from being processed before necessary methods are completed, ensuring correct cancellation of the subscription.

**Testing & Validation:**
- The fix couldn't be replicated in tests, hence the request for a release as version 2.3-beta to observe if the issue resolves.
- All existing and new tests are passing.

**Note:**
- No breaking changes were introduced by this fix. 
- Ensure documentation is updated and follows the Serverpod documentation style.
- Confirm code formatting follows the Dart Style Guide with `dart format`. 

This aims to resolve the issue without altering existing behavior.
