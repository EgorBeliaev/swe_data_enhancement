**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Feature Addition**: Implement support for transaction isolation levels in the database.
   - Introduce a `TransactionSetting` class with nullable fields allowing default "driver" settings when not explicitly set by the user.

2. **Testing Adjustments**: Ensure tests use `withServerpod` as a setup function in related test cases.

**Issue Description (if instructions are not viable):**

The PR addresses the need for improved transaction management by introducing transaction isolation levels. This provides database operations with a configurable mechanism to maintain data consistency by allowing various isolation levels. This enhancement is implemented in a backward-compatible way, ensuring existing functionality remains intact while expanding capabilities.
