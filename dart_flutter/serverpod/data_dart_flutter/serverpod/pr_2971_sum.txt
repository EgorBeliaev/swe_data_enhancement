### Changes to be Made:

1. **Remove Directory Restriction for Sealed Classes:**
   - Eliminate the restriction and related tests that previously required sealed class hierarchy members to reside in the same directory.

2. **Refactor Import Handling:**
   - In `custom_allocators.dart`, create an `ImportCollector` to manage imports.
   - Initialize `ImportCollector` with allocators and provide it the `model` path for normalization and to set paths relative to the top node.

3. **New Utility Function:**
   - Add `getGeneratedModelPath(...)` in `class_generators_util.dart` to return a model's path as a `String`.

4. **Update Directives:**
   - Modify `model_library_generator.dart` to include `part` and `part of` directives using relative paths.

5. **Implement in Generators:**
   - Instantiate `ImportCollector` in `server_code_generator.dart` and `client_code_generator.dart`.
   - Use `getGeneratedModelPath` to eliminate duplication across sealed hierarchies.

6. **Add Tests:**
   - Introduce tests in `sealed_class_test.dart` to verify correct URI generation for directives (`part` and `part of`).

7. **Fix Windows Path Handling:**
   - In `compilation_unit_helpers.dart`, add `applyWindowsBugfix(uri)` for use in `tryFindPartDirective` and `tryFindPartOfDirective` to address path separator issues on Windows.

### Fix for Existing Issue:
This PR addresses the limitation where all members of a sealed class hierarchy had to be in the same directory, allowing more flexible project structures. Additionally, it resolves path-handling issues specific to Windows environments.
