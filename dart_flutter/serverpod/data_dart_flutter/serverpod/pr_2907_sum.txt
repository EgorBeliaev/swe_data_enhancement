### Instructions for Implementation:

1. **Support DB Exceptions:**
   - Implement a rollback mechanism in test tools when an error occurs inside a transaction, and re-throw the error back to the code under test.

2. **Introduce Synchronized Lock:**
   - Add a synchronized lock for database operations within the test proxy to prevent multiple operations that could potentially fail from occurring simultaneously.

3. **Handle Concurrent Operations:**
   - Ensure the test database proxy allows only a single database operation at a time. 
   - Throw exceptions for:
     - Concurrent transaction calls.
     - Non-transaction call occurring concurrently during an ongoing transaction.

4. **Manage Save Points:**
   - Release save points when they are no longer needed, even though this is unrelated to the primary issue.

5. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Ensure new tests cover these changes adequately.
   - Confirm that all existing and new tests are passing.

### Issue this PR Addresses:

- Fixes problems related to handling emulated nested transactions in test environments. 
- Ensures database operations within transactions behave correctly and prevents invalid concurrent database states that test tools cannot handle.
