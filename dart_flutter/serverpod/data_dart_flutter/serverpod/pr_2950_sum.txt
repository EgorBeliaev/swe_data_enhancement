### Instructions for the Programmer:

1. **Feature Implementation**:
   - Implement typed support for Postgres savepoints in transactions within the repository.
   - Ensure that upon creating a savepoint in a transaction, a typed object is returned. This object should support operations like releasing or rolling back the savepoint.

2. **Test Framework**:
   - Update and migrate the existing test framework to use the new savepoint system.

3. **Documentation and Style**:
   - Follow the Dart Style Guide for code formatting.
   - Add or update relevant documentation, ensuring it aligns with the Serverpod documentation style.
   - Provide doc comments using `///` and check for spelling and grammar accuracy.

4. **Checklist Compliance**:
   - Make sure changes made in the PR address only a single feature or fix.
   - Ensure to list at least one issue that the PR fixes in the description.
   - Verify that all new and existing tests pass after changes are made.
   - Confirm that there are no breaking changes introduced; only internal adjustments to the Postgres adapter and non-breaking new methods for the transaction interface should be made.

5. **Additional Context**:
   - Be aware that the tests might be updated if a related issue (https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/pull/2546) is addressed. This could include validating expected errors.

6. **Typo Correction**:
   - Review and correct any identified typographical errors.
