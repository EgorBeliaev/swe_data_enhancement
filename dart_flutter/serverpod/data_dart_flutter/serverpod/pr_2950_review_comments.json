        "body": "Closes: #2938\r\n\r\nAdds typed support for Postgres savepoints in transactions.\r\nWhen a savepoint is created a typed object is returned that can be used to either release or rollback the savepoint.\r\n\r\nA typical transaction can looks like this:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nawait session.db.transaction<void>(\r\n  (transaction) async {\r\n    var savepoint = await transaction.createSavepoint();\r\n    await SimpleData.db\r\n        .insertRow(session, SimpleData(num: 1), transaction: transaction);\r\n    await savepoint.rollback();\r\n  },\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `transaction.createSavepoint()` creates the typed savepoint and `savepoint.rollback()` rollsback the transaction to the savepoint state.\r\n\r\nThis PR also migrates the test framework to use the new savepoint system.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nThe tests in this PR might be updated if we fix: https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/pull/2546\r\n\r\nThen we could validate that we get the expected errors.\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] I read the [Contribute](https://docs.serverpod.dev/contribute) page and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [ ] This update contains only one single feature or bug fix and nothing else. (If you are submitting multiple fixes, please make multiple PRs.)\r\n- [ ] I read and followed the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) and formatted the code with [dart format](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format).\r\n- [ ] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [ ] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`), and made sure that the documentation follows the same style as other Serverpod documentation. I checked spelling and grammar.\r\n- [ ] I added new tests to check the change I am making.\r\n- [ ] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n- [ ] Any breaking changes are documented below.\r\n\r\nIf you need help, consider asking for advice on the [discussion board](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/discussions).\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\nNone - only internal changes to the postgres adapter was required along with non breaking new methods for the transaction interface."
