Add support for placing model definitions anywhere within the `lib` directory using `*.spy`, `*.spy.yaml`, or `*.spy.yml` extensions. Ensure model files are generated in the `lib/src/generated` directory. Update subdirectory paths for generated model files to base from the following directories: `lib`, `lib/src`, `lib/src/protocol`, or `lib/src/models`. Implement restriction to prevent file name collisions in the generated files when similar names are used in `lib/src/protocol` or `lib/src/models`. No breaking changes introduced; update documentation and ensure all tests pass with the changes.
