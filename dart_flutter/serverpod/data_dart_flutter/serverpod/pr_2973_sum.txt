The pull request titled "fix: Use stateful analyzers in generator" introduces several key changes:

1. **Stateful Analyzers Usage**: Implement stateful analyzers to process both endpoints and model files within the generator, in alignment with the progress towards supporting file locations anywhere in the project. This task is tracked under issue [#964](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/issues/964).

2. **File Trigger Filtering**: Add filtering to watch files, ensuring the generator is triggered only when endpoint or model files are updated, minimizing unnecessary regenerations from unrelated file modifications.

3. **Batching Mechanism**: Introduce a small delay to batch file changes, preventing invalid states during events like file moves, where `add` and `remove` events must be processed together.

4. **Testing and Compliance**: Confirm that tests verifying file generation are in place, adhere to the Contribute guidelines, Dart Style Guide adherence, new tests added, and documentation updated with maintained consistency in style.

5. **No Breaking Changes**: Ensure that the changes retain existing behavior without introducing breaking changes.
