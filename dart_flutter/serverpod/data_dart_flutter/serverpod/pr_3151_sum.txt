### Instructions for Programmer:

1. **Code Update**: Modify the code generator to correctly handle enums where a value is named `name`. Ensure that there is no conflict with the built-in `Enum.name` property.

2. **Testing**: Add a new test to cover serialization specifically for enums with a value named `name`.

3. **Verification**: Ensure all new and existing tests are passing, as verified in the PR checklist.

4. **Documentation**: Review the checklist point on documentation and ensure any updates or additions align with the repository's existing style, including grammar and spelling. If not yet done, update documentation with relevant comments marked with `///`.

Ensure you are familiar with the handling of enums in the repository and make changes adhering to the Dart Style Guide.
