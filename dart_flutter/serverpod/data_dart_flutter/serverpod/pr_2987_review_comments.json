        "body": "Closes: #964 \r\n\r\nAdd support for placing model definitions anywhere in the `lib` directory if they use a `*.spy`, `*.spy.yaml` or `*.spy.yml` extension. \r\n\r\nThe model files are still generated in the `lib/src/generated` directory, and the subdirectory path for the generated model files will have a base from either of these paths:\r\n- `lib`\r\n- `lib/src`\r\n- `lib/src/protocol`\r\n- `lib/src/models`\r\n\r\nThis means that a new restriction has been added to prevent file collisions for the generated files. For example if a model file with the same name is placed in `lib/src/protocol` or `lib/src/models/`, this would result in the generated model file having the same name.\r\n\r\n## Pre-launch Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I read the [Contribute](https://docs.serverpod.dev/contribute) page and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs.\r\n- [x] This update contains only one single feature or bug fix and nothing else. (If you are submitting multiple fixes, please make multiple PRs.)\r\n- [x] I read and followed the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) and formatted the code with [dart format](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format).\r\n- [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above.\r\n- [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`), and made sure that the documentation follows the same style as other Serverpod documentation. I checked spelling and grammar.\r\n- [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making.\r\n- [x] All existing and new tests are passing.\r\n- [x] Any breaking changes are documented below.\r\n\r\nIf you need help, consider asking for advice on the [discussion board](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/discussions).\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\nNone - this introduces more locations to place model files with the `spy` extension."
