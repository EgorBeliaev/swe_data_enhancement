Update the URL validation logic in `Client/src/Validation/validation.js` to make the protocol optional:

1. Modify the regex to make the protocol identifier optional in the URL validation.

2. Add a check to automatically prepend 'http://' to URLs that do not start with 'http://', 'https://', or 'ftp://' and do not contain any protocol, ensuring consistent URL submission.

3. Retain existing error messaging for invalid URLs.

4. Ensure that the URL validation gracefully handles cases where protocols like 'mailto:' or 'tel:' are used by treating such URLs as invalid in this context.

5. Clean up by removing any commented-out code related to `usage_system` and `usage_swap`, to maintain a clean codebase.

Note: Ensure backend systems are prepared to handle URLs with and without protocols following these changes for consistent behavior.
