Update the code in the `NetworkService.js` file as follows:

1. **Remove Admin Checks**: Eliminate all checks related to the admin role for displaying error toasts. The error notifications should be visible to all users.

2. **Handle Errors**: Simplify the `handleError` function:
   - When `error.response` is present, execute the current response error implementation.
   - When `error.request` is present, show a toast with the message indicating the server did not respond.
   - Consider adding an `else` clause to handle unexpected errors that neither fall under `response` nor `request`.

3. **Toast Notifications**: 
   - Utilize the existing toast configuration from `Client/src/Utils/toastUtils.jsx` for consistency in toast displays.
   - Adjust the toast messages for clarity and user-friendliness.
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent toast spam by adding an ID for the toast and ensuring it auto-dismisses after a set duration.

4. **Remove Debounce Logic**: Given the feedback, address the network request issue at a higher level rather than using debounce logic for toast notifications.

5. **Documentation and Testing**: Update documentation to reflect these changes and ensure unit tests are written for the revised `handleError` and toast functionalities, covering various scenarios. Conduct integration testing to verify proper notification display.

These changes aim to improve user notifications for server issues, aligning them with the project's existing standards and improving the clarity and applicability of error messages.
