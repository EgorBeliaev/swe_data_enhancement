The Pull Request addresses redundant instantiation of the `NetworkService` in the `NetworkServiceProvider.jsx` file. The following changes are necessary:

1. **Initialization Logic Update**:
   - Modify `NetworkServiceProvider.jsx`:
     - Move the initialization of `NetworkService` into a `useEffect` hook to prevent it from running on every render.
     - Add cleanup logic inside the `useEffect` hook for when the component unmounts.
     - Ensure `useEffect` includes `[dispatch, navigate]` as dependencies.

2. **Prevent Variable Shadowing**:
   - Avoid shadowing the imported `networkService` by either renaming the local `networkService` variable or using the newly created `NetworkService` directly with the `setNetworkService` method.

3. **Implement Singleton Pattern**:
   - Refactor `NetworkService.js` using a singleton pattern:
      - Create a `getNetworkService` function that initializes `NetworkService` only once.
      - Ensure the `NetworkService` instance is exported using the `getNetworkService` function for consistent use across the application.

4. **Integration and Testing**:
   - Thoroughly test the updated control flow to ensure `NetworkService` is only initialized once and handles all edge cases and errors appropriately.

By applying these changes, the redundancy issue will be addressed and the `NetworkService` initialization will become more efficient and maintainable.
