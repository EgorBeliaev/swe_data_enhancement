Fix the CPU frequency parsing to ensure accurate and stable display on the main infrastructure dashboard. Update the code in `Client/src/Pages/Infrastructure/index.jsx` to handle potential `null` or `undefined` values in `monitor.checks[0]?.cpu` by using the following logic:

```javascript
const processor = 
    ((monitor.checks[0]?.cpu?.frequency ?? 0) / 1000).toFixed(2) + " GHz";
```

This modification prevents TypeErrors and enhances reliability. Additionally, verify the correct CPU frequency units for accurate conversion to gigahertz. 

Also, perform thorough testing on the main infrastructure dashboard to confirm CPU frequency is displayed correctly and test other parts of the system to ensure no new issues arise. Lastly, consider removing or replacing excessive console logs in production code with a structured logger to maintain clarity and performance.
