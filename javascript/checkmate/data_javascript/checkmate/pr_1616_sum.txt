The pull request addresses a significant update to the `demoMonitors.json` file located in the `Server/utils` directory. The original exhaustive list of web resources has been entirely replaced with a new set of entries that focus on major tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Amazon, and Apple. Additionally, a new file, `demoMonitorsOld.json`, has been created to preserve the original list of web resources, enabling content preservation while updating the repository to reflect the more targeted selection of tech companies.
