**Instructions for Fixing `hasMonitors` Logic in Uptime Home Component:**

1. **Update `hasMonitors` Logic:**
   - Ensure `hasMonitors` is calculated correctly in `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Home/index.jsx`.
   - Modify logic to handle `undefined` values explicitly:
     ```javascript
     const hasMonitors = totalMonitors !== undefined && totalMonitors > 0;
     ```
   - This change ensures the logic behaves correctly in all scenarios, addressing any edge cases.

2. **Testing:**
   - Add unit tests to verify the updated `hasMonitors` logic with various inputs, particularly for cases when `totalMonitors` is null, undefined, or zero.
   - Ensure integration tests are performed to validate that the UI updates correctly when `totalMonitors` changes.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update documentation for the `Home` component to reflect changes in `hasMonitors` logic and expected behavior.
   
4. **Suggestion (Optional):**
   - Consider extracting the `hasMonitors` logic into a custom hook for reusability and better isolation of business logic:
     ```javascript
     const useHasMonitors = (monitorsSummary) => {
       const totalMonitors = monitorsSummary?.totalMonitors ?? 0;
       return totalMonitors > 0;
     };
     ```

This update ensures that users can correctly interact with the monitoring features and are able to add new monitors only when conditions are met.
