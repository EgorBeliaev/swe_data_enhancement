Enhance the distributed uptime monitoring feature with the following changes:

1. **Add Request Validation:**
   - Validate the origin of incoming requests to `resultsCallback` to ensure they are from authorized UpRock sources only.

2. **Improve Data Validation:**
   - Validate the callback payload data to confirm it contains `monitorId`, `success`, and `responseTime`. Reject requests with invalid payloads.

3. **Enhance Error Handling:**
   - Improve error logging in `resultsCallback` for better specificity.
   - Forward errors to error handling middleware for consistent error management.

4. **Ngrok Management:**
   - Implement mechanisms to ensure the ngrok tunnel is properly closed when the development server shuts down.

5. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Introduce authentication or authorization middleware on the `/callback` route to restrict access to valid requests only.

6. **Database Schema Adjustments:**
   - Extend the `DistributedUptimeCheck` model with additional fields (`externalResponseTime`, `externalRawResponse`, `externalStatusCode`, `externalError`) to capture detailed external monitoring data.

7. **Router Adjustments:**
   - Use a middleware function like `verifyUpRockCallback` to enhance security for incoming callback requests.

Implement these changes to address potential vulnerabilities, improve data integrity, and ensure a robust implementation of distributed uptime monitoring.
