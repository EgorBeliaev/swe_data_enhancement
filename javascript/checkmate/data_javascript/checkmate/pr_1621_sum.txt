**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Update `jobQueue.js`**:
   - Add a new entry in the `QUEUE_LOOKUP` object to include `"port": "uptime"`.
   - Implement a new entry `"port_unresponsive": "port_unresponsive"` to handle edge cases for ports that are unresponsive.

2. **Enhance Function `getSchedulerId`**:
   - Modify the `getSchedulerId` function to include a check for unsupported monitor types. Throw an error if the monitor type is not supported, ensuring only recognized types generate scheduler IDs.

3. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Develop unit tests to cover non-responsive port scenarios, ensuring proper handling and system robustness.
   - Conduct thorough performance testing to ensure that the load on the 'uptime' queue due to the new monitor type does not degrade performance.

4. **Documentation and Security**:
   - Update documentation to include changes related to the new port type monitor.
   - Implement proper input validation, error handling, and consider access control to secure monitored ports.

5. **Load Testing**:
   - Conduct comprehensive load testing to evaluate system performance impacts, particularly concerning the new port type monitor's effects on the 'uptime' queue.
