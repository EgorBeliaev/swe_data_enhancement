### Instructions for Changes

1. **Template Update:**
   - In the `Server/templates/serverIsDown.mjml` file, replace the hardcoded "Google.com is down" text with a dynamic `{{monitor}}` placeholder.
   - Suggested improvement for error handling: Implement logic to cover cases where the `monitor` variable might be missing or empty, e.g., use a conditional statement to display "No monitor specified" if `monitor` is not provided.

2. **Formatting and Readability Enhancements:**
   - Add quotes around the `{{monitor}}` placeholder for better readability: Change `{{monitor}} is down` to `"{{monitor}}" is down`.

3. **Notifications Enhancements:**
   - Incorporate additional details for notifications to enhance informativeness:
     - Include the time the incident was detected (`{{timestamp}}`).
     - Add HTTP status code or error reason if available (`{{status_code}}`).
     - Indicate severity level (`{{severity}}`).

4. **Styling Adjustments:**
   - Apply consistent styling to the `{{monitor}}` text using HTML tags, e.g., `<strong style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">{{monitor}}</strong>` for enhanced readability and presentation.

### Summary of the Issue Being Addressed

The pull request modifies the `serverIsDown.mjml` template to replace static text with a dynamic placeholder, enabling more accurate and flexible server downtime notifications that reflect the actual monitor name that goes down instead of a generic reference.
