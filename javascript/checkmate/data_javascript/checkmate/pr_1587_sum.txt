This pull request #1584 addresses the removal of non-functional UI elements from the Uptime Configuration page. Specifically, it involves:

1. **Changes to be made:**
   - Remove the SMS and multiple email notification checkboxes.
   - Eliminate the conditional input box for adding multiple user emails.
   - Update `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Configure/index.jsx` accordingly by removing the checks and related logic tied to these non-functional elements.

2. **Code Improvements Suggested:**
   - Enhance the `handleChange` function by adding checks to validate the presence and correctness of event target properties (`id`, `value`, `type`, `checked`) to prevent potential errors.
   - In the `handleSubmit` function, implement input validation to ensure monitor data integrity after updates.

3. **Testing Recommendations:**
   - Write unit tests for `handleChange` and `handleSubmit` to validate their functionalities and handle potential edge cases.

These adjustments aim to streamline the incident notification settings, enhance user experience, and ensure robustness in the affected component.
