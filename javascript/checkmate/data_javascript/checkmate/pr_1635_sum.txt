The PR titled "Fix some UI style/Component bugs" addresses styling and component issues in the application. Here's a concise list of changes to be implemented:

1. **Count Box Style Adjustments:**
   - Adjust the style of the count box on the Uptime, Pagespeed, and Infrastructure pages to improve visual consistency.

2. **DOM Nesting Error Fix:**
   - Resolve the `validateDOMNesting` error where a `<button>` is improperly nested within another `<button>`.

3. **Sidebar Sticky Error:**
   - Correct the sticky sidebar behavior on the Infrastructure Detail page for improved functionality.

4. **UI Styling Changes:**
   - Modify the `borderRadius` property from `"50%"` to `"10000px"` in the following components:
     - `Client/src/Pages/Infrastructure/index.jsx`
     - `Client/src/Pages/PageSpeed/index.jsx`
     - `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Home/UptimeDataTable/index.jsx`
   - Simplify the logic for color determination based on uptime percentages in `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Home/index.jsx`.

5. **Code Clean-Up:**
   - Address TODO comments, particularly in `Client/src/Pages/PageSpeed/index.jsx` and `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Home/index.jsx`, focusing on removing unnecessary styles and ensuring consistency.
   - Consolidate repeated `StatusBox` component usage in `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Home/index.jsx` to use a mapping approach, enhancing maintainability.

6. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**
   - Replace the use of `infinity` with a sufficiently large value to ensure consistent behavior across browsers.

7. **Color Definition Update:**
   - Define missing color configurations for `theme.palette.percentage` and ensure consistency between the Uptime and Infrastructure pages.

These changes aim to enhance the UI styling, fix existing component issues, and improve code maintainability across the repository.
