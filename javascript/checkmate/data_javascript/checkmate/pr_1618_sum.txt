**Instructions for the Programmer:**

1. **Reintroduce IP Exclusions in Regex:**
   - Modify the `validateUrl` function in `Client/src/Validation/validation.js`.
   - Add back the exclusion for local and private IP addresses in the URL validation regex.
   - Incorporate checks to exclude IP addresses for local and private ranges such as `10.x.x.x`, `127.x.x.x`, `169.254.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`, `172.16.x.x-172.31.x.x`.

2. **Revised Edge Cases in Regex:**
   - Update the regex to additionally exclude IP addresses reserved for future use (e.g., `100.64.0.0/10`, `192.0.0.0/24`, `198.18.0.0/15`, `240.0.0.0/4`) and link-local addresses.

3. **Testing Modifications:**
   - Implement new test cases in the test suite:
     - Ensure validation fails for local IP addresses like `192.168.1.1` and private IP addresses like `10.0.0.1`.
     - Include tests to fail validation for future reserved IPs like `198.18.0.1` and link-local addresses like `169.254.0.1`.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update the documentation for `validateUrl` to detail each section's purpose and any exclusions.
