### Instructions for PR Implementation

1. **Refactor PageSpeed Monitors**: 
   - Restructure the PageSpeed Monitors page for better standardization and maintainability.
   - **Directory Structure**: Standardize directory names and structures.
   - **UI Components**: Break down into smaller components (e.g., extract navigation elements and headers).
   - **Network Operations**: Extract these into a reusable hook.
   - **Loading State Handling**: Consistently manage and display loading states across the UI.

2. **Code Improvements**:
   - **Remove Debug Statements**: Eliminate any console.log statements, especially the one identified in `MonitorHeader/index.jsx`.
   - **Component Splitting**: In `PageSpeed/Monitors/Components/Card/index.jsx`, separate the `CustomToolTip`, `PagespeedAreaChart`, and utility functions for better maintainability.

3. **Housekeeping**:
   - **Comment Clean-Up**: Remove any commented-out code and unnecessary comments, e.g., `Client/src/Routes/index.jsx` has a commented import that needs removal.
   - **Import Consistency**: Ensure import paths align with the new structure post-refactor.

4. **Component Enhancements**:
   - **Extract Common Logic**: Move common logic, such as color thresholds, into utility functions for reusability.
   - **Optional Props**: Ensure that all optional props have defaults, and necessary prop types are defined, especially for components like `MonitorCountHeader`.

5. **UI Consistency and Responsiveness**:
   - **Spacing and Styling**: Adjust any overly large spacing values and replace fixed dimensions with theme-based values for better cross-platform responsiveness.

6. **Code Optimizations**:
   - **Memoization**: Use `React.memo` and `useCallback` to optimize purely presentational components and prevent unnecessary renders.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Enhance error handling within hooks and components like `useMonitorsFetch`, including state management and retry logic for transient errors.

8. **Miscellaneous Improvements**:
   - **Ensure Consistent Breadcrumbs**: Update `BREADCRUMBS` for consistent naming conventions.
   - **Prop Type Definitions**: Refine prop types for all components, marking essential ones as required to avoid runtime issues.

### Overall Objective
This PR aims to refactor the PageSpeed feature, improve code maintainability, and standardize component usage across the application, ensuring the codebase is cleaner, more efficient, and easier to navigate.
