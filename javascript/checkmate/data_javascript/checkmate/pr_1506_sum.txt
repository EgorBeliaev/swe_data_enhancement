**Instructions to Programmer:**

1. **Update the `NetworkService.js` File:**
   - Add missing authorization headers to two methods in the `NetworkService` class:
     - `getHardwareDetailsByMonitorId`
     - `getUptimeDetailsById`
   - Implement secure token retrieval and validation methods:
     - Use `getAuthToken(config.authToken)` to securely retrieve the auth token.
     - Introduce `validateAuthTokenForAllRequests(token)` to validate the token before making requests.
   - Ensure that both functions throw an error if the auth token is invalid or missing to improve error handling.

2. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement proper token validation logic to check the token's format, expiration, and signature.
   - Securely store the auth token, ensuring it is not exposed in logs or accessible by client-side code.

3. **Testing Requirements:**
   - Write unit tests to ensure requests fail with an invalid or missing token.
   - Implement integration tests to confirm the auth token is included and correct operation of dependent features.

4. **Documentation Update:**
   - Update the documentation for `NetworkService` to reflect the new authentication handling process.
