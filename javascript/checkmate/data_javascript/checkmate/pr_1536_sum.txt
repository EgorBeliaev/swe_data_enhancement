The proposed changes in this PR are aimed at improving the performance by addressing unnecessary re-renders due to the autocomplete feature in the Uptime DataTable. Here are the instructions:

1. **Refactor Search**: Isolate the search functionality into a new `SearchComponent`. Handle the search value locally within this component using `debouncedSearch`.

2. **Optimize Performance**: Utilize `useCallback` for the `handleSearch` function to memoize it. Introduce `useMemo` to filter monitors based on the search input and optimize the search operation.

3. **UI Feedback**: Add a condition to display an error message "No monitors found" when the search yields no results.

4. **Component Integration**: Ensure that `UptimeDataTable` uses `debouncedSearch` instead of `search` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

5. **Performance Monitoring**: Be cautious with the use of `useTraceUpdate` in `UptimeDataTable`, as it can potentially lead to performance issues.

Ensure these changes do not introduce excess renders or degrade the user experience by testing and monitoring.
