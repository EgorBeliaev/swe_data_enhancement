### Instruction for Programmer:

1. **Update `hasMonitors` Logic:**
   - Modify the calculation in `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Home/index.jsx` to:
     ```javascript
     const hasMonitors = totalMonitors !== undefined && totalMonitors > 0;
     ```
   - This change explicitly checks for `undefined` values, ensuring correct behavior in all scenarios.

2. **Code Refactor:**
   - Consider encapsulating the `hasMonitors` logic in a custom hook to enhance reusability and maintainability:
     ```javascript
     const useHasMonitors = (monitorsSummary) => {
       const totalMonitors = monitorsSummary?.totalMonitors ?? 0;
       return totalMonitors > 0;
     };
     ```
   - Adjust the existing usage to:
     ```javascript
     const hasMonitors = useHasMonitors(monitorsSummary);
     ```

3. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests to cover the following scenarios for `hasMonitors` logic:
     - `totalMonitors` is 0: should return `false`.
     - `totalMonitors` is `null`: should return `false`.
     - `totalMonitors` is `undefined`: should return `false`.
     - `totalMonitors` is greater than 0: should return `true`.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update component documentation to reflect changes to the `hasMonitors` logic and describe expected behavior under different scenarios.

5. **Deployment & Operations:**
   - Ensure changes are thoroughly tested and integrated, and monitor for any unexpected behavior after deployment.

This PR addresses a logic error in determining `hasMonitors`, ensuring improved accuracy for monitor management features in the UI.
