Refactor and Fix Instructions:

1. **Frontend Fix:**
   - In `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Details/index.jsx`, ensure `monitor.stats.upChecks` is an array before using `.reduce()` for aggregating `totalChecks`. Use `Array.isArray()` for validation to prevent errors due to potential null or undefined values.

2. **Backend Refactoring:**
   - Move the query pipeline logic to a new module `monitorModuleQueries.js` for better modularity.
   - Import and utilize newly created functions `buildUptimeDetailsPipeline` and `buildHardwareDetailsPipeline` in `Server/db/mongo/modules/monitorModule.js`.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation for the functions in `monitorModuleQueries.js`, describing each function's purpose and usage for easier maintenance and future scalability.

These changes aim to ensure correct uptime check counts, enhance code readability, and improve maintainability and system scalability.
