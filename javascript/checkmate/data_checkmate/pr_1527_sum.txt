### Instruction:

- **Remove Unused Monitors:** Update both client and server code to remove unused `monitors` from state and query.
  - **Client:**
    - In `CreateUptime/index.jsx` and `Home/index.jsx`, refactor the use of redux state by eliminating `monitors`. Ensure the state destructuring only includes necessary elements like `isLoading` and `monitorsSummary`.
  - **Server:**
    - In `monitorController.js`, replace any use of `getMonitorsAndSummaryByTeamId` with `getMonitorsSummaryByTeamId` to focus only on summary retrieval.
    - Modify the MongoDB aggregation pipeline in `monitorModule.js` to optimize for summary data, ensuring edge cases and potential null values are handled.

- **Configuration and Logging:**
  - In `settingsService.js`, validate and document `logLevel` values derived from `process.env.LOG_LEVEL`. Add defaults and comprehensive comments to prevent unexpected behaviors.

- **Validation Updates:**
  - Update validation schemas in `joi.js` to align with new method names and parameter usage, ensuring all references to monitors are accurate.

- **Additional Recommendations (optional):**
  - Implement caching for summary data to enhance performance.
  - Adjust database indexes to support the new aggregation queries effectively.
  - Update documentation to reflect changes in the summary endpoint logic and removed monitors data.

This PR focuses on simplifying the monitor summary process by removing unnecessary data management, thereby enhancing the performance and maintainability of the repository.
