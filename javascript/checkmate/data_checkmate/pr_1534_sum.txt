This PR addresses an issue with the missing skeleton in the `UptimeMonitors` component on the Uptime home page. Here's a concise summary of the necessary changes:

1. **Update Loading Logic**: Modify `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Home/index.jsx` to include the `SkeletonLayout` component when data is loading, ensuring the loading state is visually indicated.

2. **Improve Accessibility**: Ensure the `SkeletonLayout` component provides clear visual loading indicators accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.

3. **Conditional Rendering Enhancement**: Restructure the rendering logic within `UptimeMonitors` to check for the loading state first, then the presence of monitors, and render the appropriate content accordingly.

4. **Implement Suggested Improvements**: Refactor the `SkeletonLayout` to wrap a `Stack` component which includes `StatusBox` components for "up", "down", and "paused" states, ensuring a robust loading state UI is presented even in case of rendering errors within the `StatusBox`.

5. **Testing**: Implement tests to confirm:
   - The `SkeletonLayout` renders correctly during loading.
   - Status boxes render appropriately when not loading.
   - An error message appears if the `SkeletonLayout` fails to render.

6. **Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect changes to the `UptimeMonitors` component, especially regarding the addition of the `SkeletonLayout`.

7. **Performance Considerations**: Conduct performance tests to verify that the `SkeletonLayout` does not degrade application performance.

These changes are aimed at enhancing the user experience by ensuring that the application provides clear visual feedback during data retrieval processes.
