### Changes to be Made:

1. **Autocomplete Component Enhancements:**
   - Update the autocomplete component to display all monitors instead of just the monitors on the current page. This requires modifying the search component and data retrieval processes:
     - Ensure `filteredMonitors` is used across client-side components like Search, Infrastructure, PageSpeed, and Uptime pages.
     - Update API endpoints in `Server/db/mongo/modules/monitorModule.js` to return filtered monitor data.

2. **Error Handling and State Management:**
   - Add error handling for missing `filteredMonitors` in the current code to prevent runtime errors if the API response structure changes.
   - Introduce an `isLoading` state in `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Home/index.jsx` to manage loading states and provide a loading indicator to improve user experience.

3. **Code Optimization and Indexing:**
   - Optimize state updates and destructuring in places like `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Home/index.jsx`.
   - Add text and compound indexes in MongoDB to enhance the search performance and efficiency.

4. **PropTypes and Document Updates:**
   - Enhance PropTypes validation for `filteredMonitors`, specifying the expected object structure.
   - Update documentation for the autocomplete component to reflect changes in data retrieval processes and the introduction of `filteredMonitors`.

5. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Conduct thorough performance testing of the autocomplete component with varying numbers of monitors to ensure responsiveness.
   - Add unit and integration tests to ensure that all changes perform as expected across relevant pages and components.

### Issue Being Fixed:
This pull request resolves the issue where the autocomplete component only displayed monitors from the current page by ensuring that all monitors are available for search and autocomplete functionality, aligning it with business requirements for improved usability and effectiveness.
