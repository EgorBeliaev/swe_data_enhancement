**Title:** Fix: Reduce Size of Demo Monitors

1. **Update `demoMonitors.json`:**
   - Completely replace the existing entries of over 100 niche websites with new entries focusing on major tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Amazon, and Apple.
   
2. **Add `demoMonitorsOld.json`:**
   - Create and add a new file to the repository named `demoMonitorsOld.json`. This file is intended to preserve the original list of web resources from the `demoMonitors.json`.

These changes introduce a more focused set of demo monitors while maintaining the integrity of the original data for archival purposes.
