### Instruction to Programmer:
1. **Fix CPU Frequency Retrieval:**
   - Update the calculation of CPU frequency in `Client/src/Pages/Infrastructure/index.jsx` to ensure proper display format:
     ```javascript
     const processor = ((monitor.checks[0]?.cpu?.frequency ?? 0) / 1000).toFixed(2) + " GHz";
     ```
   - Ensure error handling is in place to prevent TypeErrors when `monitor.checks[0]?.cpu` might be `null` or `undefined`.

2. **Console Log Management:**
   - Remove or replace direct `console.log` statements for debugging purposes:
     - Line 152: Switch from `console.log(monitor)` to a dedicated debug logger or comment it out.
     - Line 185: Replace with `console.info(monitorsAsRows)` or comment it.

3. **Testing and Edge Case Handling:**
   - Implement unit tests to validate the correct display of CPU frequency.
   - Add test cases to handle scenarios where `monitor.checks[0]?.cpu` is `null` or `undefined`.

4. **Documentation and Maintenance:**
   - Update the documentation for related issue (#1620) with the fix information.
   - Ensure the variable used for retrieving CPU frequency is up-to-date with any changes in data structure.

5. **Correct CPU Frequency Units:**
   - Verify whether the CPU frequency is in MHz or another unit and adjust the division factor appropriately.

### Summary:
The PR is addressing a critical issue where the CPU frequency was not being displayed on the main infrastructure dashboard. Improvements include fixing the logic with added error handling for edge cases, managing debugging logs, and enhancing the testing strategy to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data displayed.
