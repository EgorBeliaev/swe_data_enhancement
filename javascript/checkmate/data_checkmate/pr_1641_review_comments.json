        "body": "# Auto Pull Request Review from LlamaPReview\n\n## 1. Overview\n### 1.1 PR Summary\n- **Business value and requirements alignment**: This PR fixes a redundant instantiation of `NetworkService`, which could lead to performance issues and unexpected behavior. Fixing this aligns with the application's goal of maintaining high performance and stability.\n- **Key components modified**: `NetworkServiceProvider` and `NetworkService`.\n- **Impact assessment**: The change affects the utility layer and could have system-wide implications. It's crucial to validate that the new control flow works correctly with other parts of the application.\n- **System dependencies and integration impacts**: The `NetworkService` is used across multiple components and features. Changes to its initialization could impact the application's responsiveness, error handling, and real-time monitoring features.\n\n### 1.2 Architecture Changes\n- **System design modifications**: The change introduces a new control flow for initializing `NetworkService`, using a singleton pattern with a `getNetworkService` function.\n- **Component interactions**: The change affects the interaction between `NetworkServiceProvider` and `NetworkService`. It ensures that `NetworkService` is initialized only once, regardless of where the initialization occurs.\n- **Integration points**: The change doesn't directly impact integration points, but it's crucial to ensure that the new control flow works correctly with other parts of the application.\n\n## 2. Detailed Technical Analysis\n### 2.1 Code Logic Deep-Dive\n#### Core Logic Changes\n\n- **Client/src/Utils/NetworkServiceProvider.jsx**\n  - **Submitted PR Code:**\n```javascript\n    if (!networkService) {\n      const networkService = new NetworkService(store, dispatch, navigate);\n      setNetworkService(networkService);\n    }\n```\n  - **Analysis:**\n    - The current logic checks if `networkService` is not initialized before instantiating it. This is a good approach to prevent redundant instantiation.\n    - However, it introduces a new control flow that needs to be validated to ensure it handles all edge cases correctly.\n    - If `NetworkService` is initialized elsewhere in the application, this change could cause it to be instantiated twice, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.\n    - The change doesn't directly impact cross-component interactions, but it's crucial to ensure that the new control flow works correctly with other parts of the application.\n    - There are no business logic considerations specific to this change.\n\n  - **LlamaPReview Suggested Improvements:**\n```javascript\n    let networkService = getNetworkService();\n    if (!networkService) {\n      networkService = new NetworkService(store, dispatch, navigate);\n      setNetworkService(networkService);\n    }\n```\n  - **Improvement rationale:**\n    - Adding a `getNetworkService` function allows for better control over where and how `NetworkService` is initialized. This function can be used elsewhere in the application to initialize `NetworkService` if needed.\n    - This approach ensures that `NetworkService` is initialized only once, regardless of where the initialization occurs.\n    - It also makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n    - The tradeoff is that it introduces a new function that needs to be maintained. However, the benefits of improved control flow and maintainability outweigh this tradeoff.\n\n- **Client/src/Utils/NetworkService.js**\n  - **Submitted PR Code:**\n```javascript\n    export default class NetworkService {\n      // ...\n    }\n    export const networkService = new NetworkService();\n```\n  - **Analysis:**\n    - The current logic initializes `NetworkService` directly in this file. This could lead to unexpected behavior if `NetworkServiceProvider` tries to initialize it again.\n    - This change also makes it difficult to control where and when `NetworkService` is initialized.\n\n  - **LlamaPReview Suggested Improvements:**\n```javascript\n    let networkServiceInstance;\n    export function getNetworkService() {\n      if (!networkServiceInstance) {\n        networkServiceInstance = new NetworkService();\n      }\n      return networkServiceInstance;\n    }\n```\n  - **Improvement rationale:**\n    - Using a singleton pattern with a `getNetworkService` function ensures that `NetworkService` is initialized only once, regardless of where the initialization occurs.\n    - This approach allows for better control over where and when `NetworkService` is initialized, preventing the issue of it being initialized twice.\n    - The tradeoff is that it introduces a new function that needs to be maintained. However, the benefits of improved control flow and maintainability outweigh this tradeoff.\n\n#### Cross-cutting Concerns\n- **Error handling**: Ensure that any errors during `NetworkService` initialization are properly handled and propagated. This could include logging, displaying error messages, or retrying initialization.\n- **Performance**: While the change is intended to improve performance by preventing redundant instantiation, it's crucial to validate that this change doesn't introduce any performance regressions.

This modification prevents unnecessary multiple instantiations by ensuring that a new object is only created when `networkService` is not already defined. The update involves adding a conditional statement and updating the import to include the `networkService` variable from the `NetworkService` module.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File | Change Summary |\n|------|----------------|\n| `Client/src/Utils/NetworkServiceProvider.jsx` | Added conditional check for `networkService` instantiation; Updated import to include `networkService` |\n\n## Sequence Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant NSP as NetworkServiceProvider\n    participant NS as NetworkService\n    \n    alt networkService not defined\n        NSP->>NS: Create new NetworkService instance\n        NSP->>NSP: setNetworkService(newInstance)\n    else networkService already exists\n        NSP-->>NSP: Use existing networkService\n    end\n``` \n\nThe sequence diagram illustrates the new conditional logic for creating and setting the `networkService`, showing how the system now checks for an existing instance before instantiation.\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end -->\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udcdc Recent review details</summary>\n\n**Configuration used: .coderabbit.yaml**\n**Review profile: CHILL**\n**Plan: Pro**\n\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udce5 Commits</summary>\n\nReviewing files that changed from the base of the PR and between 22cae67ffef202892d0e4cb235a99232645dc8e0 and 7c889dde4788d904218ba90f612e30348a0e7905.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udcd2 Files selected for processing (1)</summary>\n\n* `Client/src/Utils/NetworkServiceProvider.jsx` (1 hunks)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udea7 Files skipped from review as they are similar to previous changes (1)</summary>\n\n* Client/src/Utils/NetworkServiceProvider.jsx\n\n</details>\n\n</details>\n<!-- internal state start -->\n\n\n<!-- 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 -->\n\n<!-- internal state end -->\n<!-- tips_start -->\n\n---\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"
