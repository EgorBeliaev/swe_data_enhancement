This pull request addresses issues with the Axios error handler implementation in the frontend of the repository, specifically in two files:

1. **`Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Home/index.jsx` Modifications:**
   - Replace static error message with `error.message`. Ensure a fallback is used when `error.message` is undefined to avoid displaying a blank or technical error message. Consider sanitizing the error message to avoid exposing sensitive information.

2. **`Client/src/Utils/NetworkService.js` Modifications:**
   - Simplify error handling in the response interceptor by removing unnecessary code. Handle the case where a successful request returns an empty response by rejecting it with a specific error (`'Network error: No response received'`).
   - Update 401 error handling by ensuring that the application only clears the user session when the response contains a 401 status code, even in cases where the request is unsuccessful.

Key considerations involve testing these changes under various network conditions to ensure that error handling behaves as expected without exposing sensitive data or causing unexpected session behavior.
