This PR updates the `serverIsDown.mjml` email template to dynamically display the actual monitor name instead of the previously hardcoded "Google.com". The following instructions are suggested for implementing changes:

1. **Update the Email Template:**
   - Replace the static "Google.com is down" text with a dynamic placeholder `{{monitor}}`.
   - Implement error handling for scenarios where the `monitor` variable is missing or empty using conditional logic, e.g.:
     ```html
     {{#monitor}}{{monitor}} is down{{/monitor}}{{^monitor}}No monitor specified{{/monitor}}
     ```

2. **Enhance Readability:**
   - Wrap the `{{monitor}}` placeholder text in quotes for improved readability.

3. **Styling Adjustments:**
   - Add consistent styling, such as using `<strong style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">` for the monitor name, to ensure uniform and visually appealing notifications.

4. **Additional Enhancements (Optional):**
   - Consider displaying additional information like the timestamp of incident detection, HTTP status code, and severity level in the notification for more comprehensive messaging.

Note: These changes expand the templateâ€™s functionality for more accurate and context-aware notifications while maintaining user experience and readability.
