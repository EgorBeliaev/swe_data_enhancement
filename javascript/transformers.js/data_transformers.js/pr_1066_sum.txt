**Instructions for Implementation:**

1. **Enhancements and Example Addition:**
   - Add a `GenerationConfig` option for `TextStreamer`.
   - Include an example in the documentation to demonstrate the usage of `GenerationConfig` with `TextStreamer`.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Ensure that the documentation changes reflect accurately in the [provided endpoint](https://moon-ci-docs.huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/pr_1066).
   - Note: Documentation changes will be available for 30 days post last update.

3. **Contributing Examples:**
   - For the `chat-streaming` example, contribute it to the `transformers.js-examples` repository.
   - Use Vite with Tailwind styling or other stacks; ensure simplicity in showcasing the streaming feature.
   - Consider adding a second, more complex example to demonstrate passing information from a web worker, if desired.
   - If using Next.js, be cautious about the non-static nature it introduces.

The PR primarily focuses on enhancing the `TextStreamer` functionality and improving documentation with relevant examples. It is also aligned with repository restructuring by moving examples to a dedicated repository.
