        "body": "Fix that padding was stretching the original image, and the right side was overflowing the container.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nThis is the code I used to generate the images.  \r\nI resize the images, so that they can be padded again to the same height as the original image.\r\n```javascript\r\nRawImage.fromBlob(file)\r\n.then(image => image.resize((256 / image.height) * image.width, 256))\r\n.then(image => image.pad([128, 128, 128, 128]))\r\n.then(image => image.save('padded.png'));\r\n```\r\n\r\n| Original image | Old solution | New solution |\r\n|----------------|--------------|--------------|\r\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a819473d-f7d3-474c-a32f-baa60e6bb5dd\" alt=\"A Moana Loungefly backpack on a white background\"> | <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fbf3226-b00c-4aa9-9f7a-5488cb1a9c1c\" alt=\"A Moana Loungefly backpack, where this is 128 pixels of padding along the top and left, however the image is cropped on the right and bottom\"> | <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/121075be-0abe-4f76-8a60-9e6a4fc1b779\" alt=\"A Moana Loungefly backpack where there is an even 128 pixels of padding all around, and the image is still 256 pixels tall\"> |\r\n\r\nAs you can see above, the old solution will add the 128 pixel padding to the top and left, however the image is resized and drawn with the same size as the canvas, hence it is cropped by 128 pixels on the right and bottom.\r\n\r\nHowever, the new solution will correctly draw the image with the provided padding all around as we now draw the image with the same dimensions that it was passed in with.\r\n\r\n## Explanation\r\nThe current implementation was drawing the image with a width of `newWidth`, where `newWidth` will be the entire width.  \r\nThis is incorrect, since the width should remain unchanged when drawing, otherwise the image will become stretched.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we are getting the correct left padding and top padding, but the right and bottom of the image are getting cropped off since the image is being stretched out.  \r\n\r\n[From the docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/drawImage), the `sWidth` and `sHeight` should match `dWidth` and `dHeight`."
