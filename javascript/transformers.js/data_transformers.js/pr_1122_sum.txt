## Instructions for Programmer:

1. **Objective**: Resolve TypeScript import errors for `transformers.js` as part of partial resolution for issue #1093.

2. **Key Changes**:
   - Apply minimal fixes to type declarations without using `@ts-ignore` or changing the existing architecture/design.
   - The focus is on making `transformers.js` functional with TypeScript.

3. **Scope of Fix**:
   - Partially resolves TypeScript errors; HTML element errors require adding "DOM" to "lib" in `tsconfig` for full resolution.
   - Full architectural changes and duck typed shims for HTML elements are outside the scope of this PR.

4. **Specific Issues Addressed**:
   - Undefined `PretrainedProcessorOptions`.
   - Mismatched return types in `batch_decode` method.
   - Non-existing properties (`padding`, `truncation`, `num_crops`) on type `any[]`.

5. **Documentation**: 
   - Documentation for the changes is available [here](https://moon-ci-docs.huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/pr_1122) and will be accessible for 30 days post the last update.

Make these adjustments to address the immediate TypeScript compatibility issues when importing `transformers.js`.
