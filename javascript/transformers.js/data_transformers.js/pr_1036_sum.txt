**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Feature Addition:**
   - Introduce a new argument `op_block_list` to the quantize script. This allows users to specify operations that should not be quantized due to incompatibility.

2. **Regression Testing:**
   - Ensure that there are no regressions when the `op_block_list` is not provided by testing with the `onnx-models/sentence-t5-base-onnx` model.
   - Perform file size verification to ensure consistencyâ€”compare results with and without PR changes. Ensure the size remains at 220762121 bytes.

3. **Qwen2-VL Testing:**
   - Test that the `op_block_list` functions as expected using the `Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct-ONNX-Q4-F16` model.
   - Conduct quantization without and with the `op_block_list` and verify the presence of a type mismatch error when the block list is absent.
   - Use the following block list: `Conv, DynamicQuantizeLinear, DequantizeLinear, Resize` to verify correct model functionality without errors.

4. **Behavioral Clarification:**
   - Note that providing an `op_block_list` overrides default exclusions and does not include them unless explicitly passed. Consider setting `None` as the default value of `op_block_list` to maintain default exclusions unless specifically overridden.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Check for updated documentation on the linked endpoint to ensure all changes are appropriately documented and accessible. Updates will reflect documentation changes from the PR (`transformers.js/pr_1036`). Available for 30 days after last update.

Ensure all changes are thoroughly tested and documented, aligning with the described test plan and regression verification procedures.
