**Objective:** Add functionality to apply a mask to a `RawImage`, replacing the image's alpha channel with mask values.

**Instructions for Code Changes:**

1. **Functionality Addition:**
   - Implement a new function to apply a mask to a `RawImage`. This function should replace the alpha channel of the image with the values from a mask image.

2. **Image Processing Steps:**
   - Import an image from a URL into a `RawImage` object.
   - Clone and add padding to the image as needed.
   - Use `AutoModel` to process the image for mask generation.

3. **Mask Application:**
   - Resize the generated mask to match the original image's dimensions, considering resizing and center cropping to accommodate pre-trained model sizes.
   - Apply the resized mask to the `RawImage` using the `applyMask` method.

4. **File Management:**
   - Save the final masked image to a file, e.g., 'masked_image.png'.

5. **Naming Revision:**
   - Rename the `applyMask` function to `putalpha` to better reflect its functionalityâ€”updating alpha channel (mask application).

6. **Future Work:**
   - Follow up with a new PR to add unit tests to support 3-channel and 4-channel images owing to a current permission error preventing branch integration.

This PR aims to enhance functionality for background removal by efficiently applying mask data to images, resembling methodologies found in the Python Imaging Library (PIL).
