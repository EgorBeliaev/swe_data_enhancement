### Changes to be Implemented:

1. **New Argument Implementation:**
   - Add a new argument called `op_block_list` to the quantize script.
   - Ensure that if `op_block_list` is provided, the ops specified are not quantized.

2. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Implement a regression test to ensure no behavioral regressions when `op_block_list` is not provided.
   - Validate the exclusion of specific ops (`/model/model.0/auto_model/encoder/block.0/layer.0/SelfAttention/Range`) using default exclude types.
   - Conduct tests with the main branch and the PR branch of transformers.js, ensuring file sizes remain unchanged to confirm no regression.

3. **Additional Test - Qwen2-VL:**
   - Validate `op_block_list` functionality with Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct model.
   - Ensure model quantization without `op_block_list` raises an expected type error.
   - Test quantization with `op_block_list` (block operators: Conv, DynamicQuantizeLinear, DequantizeLinear, Resize), verifying successful inference without errors.

4. **Behavior Update:**
   - Modify the script so that if `op_block_list` is provided, it initially defaults to `None` rather than overriding default exclude types.
   - Ensure comprehensive tests reflect this change in the PR description and update accordingly.

### Documentation:
- Ensure related documentation is updated to reflect these changes, available at the specified temporary endpoint.

### Issue Fix:
- Addressed a type error issue when specific ops were quantized incorrectly without the implementation of `op_block_list`. This ensures that incompatible operations with quantization are correctly handled and excluded.
