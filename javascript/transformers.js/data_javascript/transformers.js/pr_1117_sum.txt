**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Feature Addition**: Implement functionality to visualize self-attention heatmaps and sequence classifier outputs with attentions in the repository.

2. **Functionality Details**:
   - Add support for visualizing per-layer, per-head attentions using the DINO model for image classification.
   - Ensure that the visualization is based on the final layer's attention maps.

3. **Example Implementation**: 
   - Load models and processors with `AutoProcessor` and `AutoModelForImageClassification`.
   - Process image input and perform inference to obtain both logits and attentions.
   - Identify and log the predicted class using logits.
   - Define configuration settings, such as patch size, feature map dimensions, and the number of attention heads.
   - Extract and upscale attention maps from the last model layer using interpolation to match input image dimensions.
   - Normalize and save attention heatmaps for each attention head, with outputs named in the format `attn-head-{i}.png`.

4. **Documentation**: 
   - Refer to the documentation changes at the provided URL for guidance and validation. Ensure the updates relate to this feature for accurate post-release documentation reflection.

Ensure these updates are aligned with the repository's existing architectural and coding standards.
