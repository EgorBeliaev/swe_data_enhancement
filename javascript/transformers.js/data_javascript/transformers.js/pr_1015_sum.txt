**Instructions for Fixing the Image Padding Bug:**

1. **Problem Description:**
   - The existing implementation stretches images when padding them, resulting in the image being cropped on the right and bottom sides.

2. **Current Issue:**
   - The right side of the image overflows the container when padding is applied.
   - The image gets stretched due to incorrect width (`newWidth`) being used, which includes padding.

3. **Corrective Action:**
   - Change the implementation to ensure the `sWidth` and `sHeight` (source dimensions) match `dWidth` and `dHeight` (destination dimensions) as per [CanvasRenderingContext2D documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/drawImage).
   - Retain original image dimensions when drawing to prevent stretching and cropping.

4. **Expected Outcome:**
   - Implement padding such that the image maintains its original dimensions and is not stretched out.
   - Ensure equal padding all around without cropping, as demonstrated in the PR.

Ensure the adjustments are thoroughly tested to confirm the dimensions are correctly maintained without introducing new issues.
