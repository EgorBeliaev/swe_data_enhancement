### Instructions for Implementation:

1. **Feature Addition:**
   - Implement support for zero-shot object detection using the `onnx-community/grounding-dino-tiny-ONNX` model with the following APIs:
     - `pipeline` API.
     - `AutoModel` API.

2. **Pipeline API Example:**
   - Use the `pipeline` function to load the zero-shot object detection model.
   - Prepare the input image URL and candidate labels.
   - Set a confidence threshold of 0.3 for detection results.

3. **AutoModel API Example:**
   - Load the model and processor using `AutoModelForZeroShotObjectDetection` and `AutoProcessor`.
   - Preprocess image and text input (ensure text is lowercase and ends with a dot).
   - Post-process outputs with specified box and text thresholds of 0.3.

4. **Testing:**
   - Ensure that unit tests are added to verify the functionality of the new support. (Note: The original author is in the process of adding final unit tests).

5. **Documentation:**
   - Documentation changes have been made and can be reviewed at the provided link. Ensure that these changes are aligned with the implementation.

6. **Collaboration:**
   - Coordinate with the original author if needed for clarifications on the unit tests or code logic.

This PR enhances the repository by introducing zero-shot object detection capabilities using two APIs while ensuring comprehensive testing and updated documentation.
