**Instruction:**

Modify the `PreTrainedModel` class in the `src/models.js` file to improve code robustness by using optional chaining. Specifically, update the `batch_size` calculation to access the `dims` property using optional chaining to handle scenarios where `dims` might be undefined. This change ensures more graceful error handling during the batch size calculation process. 

*Please refer to the specific code section in `src/models.js` that requires updating.*
