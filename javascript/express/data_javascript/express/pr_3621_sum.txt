**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Change Default Setting**: Update the default setting of the query parser from 'extended' to 'simple'.

2. **Deprecation Handling**:
   - Add a deprecation warning in version 4.x (if feasible) for users not explicitly setting `app.set('query parser', 'extended')`.
   - This warning should be triggered at the creation of the `query` middleware, similar to the handling in `express.urlencoded`.

3. **Release Plan**:
   - Ensure the changes are included in the 5.0 release.
   - No need to wait for a full deprecation cycle in 4.x if impractical, but aim to follow the Node.js deprecation model.
   
4. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Conduct testing prior to the 5.0 release to catch potential bugs.
   - Include relevant documentation updates in the 5.0 branch about the change.

5. **Express-URLencoded Consistency**:
   - Make similar changes to `express.urlencoded` to maintain functional consistency across modules.

6. **Next Steps for PR**:
   - Merge the changes into the 5.x branch and ensure it's available in alpha npm releases for early detection of issues.
   - Coordinate with related PRs (notably #4208) to remove any dependency and streamline the changes into the upcoming release cycle.
