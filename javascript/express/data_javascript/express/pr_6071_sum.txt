**Instruction:**

1. Update the repository to use `node:buffer` instead of `safe-buffer`, as Node.js 18 or newer no longer requires `safe-buffer`.
2. This change is categorized as a `fix` or `feat` rather than a "chore".
3. Ensure there are no instances of `new Buffer` since they are not found in the current repository state.
