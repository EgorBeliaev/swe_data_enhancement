I am planning to have this all completed this week."

I'm happy to help out in any way (e.g. one of the pull requests on `depd` is from me before I realised it had already been tackled twice before). Would it perhaps be worth switching the `depd` dependency to a more actively maintained fork?"

Unless you mention a user by name, posts only go to repo subscribers. I do maintain it and sorry that my subscription was not on the repo.
