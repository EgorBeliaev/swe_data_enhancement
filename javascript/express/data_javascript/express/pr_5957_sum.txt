This pull request addresses the issue that method functions with no path should error in the repository. It is dependent on another pull request (PR #5956) which should be merged first. Note that changes pulled in via cherry-pick may need revision due to unintentional auto-formatting by a text editor; make sure to disable auto-formatting in neovim's TypeScript tools for JavaScript files to prevent unintended changes.
