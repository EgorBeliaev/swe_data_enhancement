The primary focus of this PR is to upgrade the `depd` dependency to version `2.0.0`. Here's what needs to be done:

1. **Upgrade `depd`:**  
   - Update the `depd` package to version `2.0.0`.
   - Ensure that all sub-dependencies within the repository are compatible and updated correspondingly to maintain an eval-free configuration for the 4.x release.

2. **Consider Upcoming Changes:**
   - Keep in mind that `depd` along with `cookie-signature` are intended for the 5.0 release based on the discussions, yet ensure the `depd` update fits within the 4.x release plan.

3. **Monitor Compatibility:**
   - Verify if the major update of `http-errors` caused by the `depd` update does not affect the major version compatibility within Express for this release.

4. **Progress and Feedback:**
   - Stay updated with the maintainer's progress regarding the `depd` dependency chain completion, expected within the week.

5. **Security Implications:**
   - Be aware of the effort to move from `eval` to potentially more secure alternatives like `new Function`, though note any current limitations in the progress of the `depd` package development.

6. **Communication:**
   - Respond to inquiries regarding the status of `depd`, and ensure any raised issues or pull requests receive attention to prevent delays or perceived inactivity.

The issue at hand is related to security concerns and maintaining package continuity with an eval-free version of `depd` for the 4.x release while concurrently addressing potential changes aligned for release 5.0.
