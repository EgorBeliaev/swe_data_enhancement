It is a `fix` or `feat` (honestly in this case I could see it going either way) and also the \"scope\" section here is not really necessary. Not a big deal since we don't *really* enforce the conventional commit conventions anyway, but just figured I would drop this note with the approval in case you wanted to edit it before we merge."
