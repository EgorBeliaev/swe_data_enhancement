The pull request proposes a change to use a random port (`port 0`) in tests to prevent failures caused by the port being already in use on the local machine, as experienced with `port 9999`. Additionally, a test should be added to verify that when a specific port `x` is provided, the application correctly listens on port `x`. 

Key instructions and changes:
1. Update the test to use `port 0` instead of a fixed port to avoid conflicts with ports already in use.
2. Add a new test to verify that when a specified port `x` is given, the application listens correctly on that port.
3. Modify the newly added tests to ensure compatibility with older Node.js versions that do not support `Promises`.
4. (Optional) Address unrelated failures observed in the CI (appveyor) tests potentially by rerunning or investigating those specific failures.

This PR addresses the issue of test failures due to port conflicts on the local development environment.
