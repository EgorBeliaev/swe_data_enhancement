**Change Summary:**

- Update the creation method for `app.cache`, `app.engines`, `app.settings`, and `app.locals` by replacing `{}` with `Object.create(null)`.
- Add a test to ensure `app.locals` is created using `Object.create(null)`.

**Issues Addressed:**

- Ensures that properties (`app.cache`, `app.engines`, `app.settings`, `app.locals`) use an object with a null prototype, eliminating any unintended inherited properties.
