Issue: The PR addresses a confusing error message that occurs when an invalid argument (non-string) is passed to the `sendFile` function. Previously, the error was `TypeError: path.substring is not a function`. This has been improved to: "path must be string."

Instructions:
1. Ensure that when a non-string value is passed to `sendFile`, it throws the error "path must be string" instead of a misleading TypeError.
2. Add a new test case that specifically checks for the improved error handling when passing invalid arguments (e.g., an object) to `sendFile`. This is critical to prevent regression in future refactors.
