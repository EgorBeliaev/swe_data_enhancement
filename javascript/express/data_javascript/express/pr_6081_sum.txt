**Instruction for Changes:**
Remove the `Object.setPrototypeOf` polyfill from the codebase as it is no longer necessary. This removal is due to Express now requiring Node.js v18 as the minimum supported version. Make sure to verify that all existing tests pass, as this change affects only older, unsupported Node.js versions. Ensure the change is documented in the project history as needed.
