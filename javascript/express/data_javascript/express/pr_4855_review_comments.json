It provides the non-breaking change to the code suggested in the linked issue (thus resolving the filename to an absolute path *only* if `options.root` is not set).\r\n\r\nI have:\r\n- [x] added a test covering the change (as `res.download()` relies on `res.sendFile()`, all of the various cases with root in options get dealt with in the sendFile tests).\r\n- [x] run linter.\r\n"
