**Instruction for the Programmer:**

Remove the `--bail` flag from the test script. The original purpose of the `bail` flag was for local development, but it has unintentionally been included in the CI script, causing test execution to stop after the first failure. Adjust the script to ensure that it no longer contains the `--bail` flag and update the CI configuration if necessary to avoid using the `bail` option during CI. Consider the preference for removing `bail` entirely instead of using a workaround like `-- --bail=false`.
