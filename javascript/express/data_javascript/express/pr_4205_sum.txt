### Issue Description:
The PR addresses a bug in regular expression handling for path routing. Specifically, when a regular expression matches a path not from the beginning, `trim_prefix` incorrectly validates path breaks using path separators.

### Initial Problem:
- **Path Example:**
  ```
  Original Path:  /test/api/123
  Layer Path:     /api/123
  [Initial Incorrect Matching Point]
  ```

### Proposed Fix:
- Adjust the logic to test the matched `layerPath` starting from the match's beginning rather than the beginning of the path.
- **Fixed Path Matching:**
  ```
  Original Path:  /test/api/123
  Corrected Start Index:  ^
  Layer Path:     /api/123
  [Corrected Matching Point]
  ```

### Modifications:
1. **Revert Initial Change:** The initial change introduced mangled `req.url` within `app.use`, thus wasn't aligned with its prefix matching function.
   
2. **Add a Unit Test:** Showcase the initial issue, validating the fixed behavior for regression testing.

3. **Adjust Regex Logic (Discussed Fix):**
   - Modify regex matching logic in `app.use` to ensure `^` is added to the beginning if not already specified by the user.
   - Confirm this logic is consistent, with an example of how it transforms paths like `/api` to `/^\\/api\\/?(?=\\/|$)/i`.

### Final Resolution:
- A solution has been committed to the upstream `router` repository, addressing the bug with added checks for consistency.
- This upstream fix will be ported to this PR to ensure compatibility and correctness in the upcoming 4.x release (4.18).

**Developer Note:** Ensure that the fix aligns with the expected path handling before the merge. This change should not alter any existing behavior for paths starting from the path's beginning, maintaining legacy compatibility.
