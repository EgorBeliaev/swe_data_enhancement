**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **CI Run Configuration:**
   - Configure CI to run only for push events on the following selected branches:
     - `master`
     - `develop`
     - `4.x`
     - `5.x`
   - Continue running CI for all PRs regardless of branch.

2. **Markdown File Changes:**
   - Skip CI runs if changes are made solely to `.md` (Markdown) files, as these do not require linting.

3. **Manage CI Concurrency:**
   - Implement the GitHub Actions concurrency group feature to ensure that for a given PR or branch (`HEAD`), only the latest CI workflow is executed. Cancel any older workflows when a newer trigger occurs.

These changes aim to cut down on duplicated CI runs, ensuring more efficient use of CI resources without impacting essential processes, such as Windows tests handled via AppVeyor.
