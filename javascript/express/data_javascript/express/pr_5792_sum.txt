**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Modify `res.clearCookie()`**:
   - Ensure that the function ignores `expires` and deletes `maxAge` from the options object. This prevents cookies from being set with future `expires` values due to a `maxAge` being specified.

2. **Address ESLint Configuration**:
   - Update the `.eslintrc.yml` to include `ecmaVersion: 2022`, targeting Node 18 and above.
   - Alternatively, modify the usage of the spread syntax to `Object.assign` to avoid immediate linting issues.

3. **CI Configuration**:
   - Identify discrepancies between 5.0 branch protection and master CI configurations.
   - Address the pending Node 22 job requirement, which is misconfigured.

4. **Prepare for Merge**:
   - Synchronize the PR with any upcoming release of v4. Review and address any potential merge conflicts or test failures related to this PR.
   - Consider merging to 5.0 as soon the v4 sync is completed and ensure all test reconciliations are addressed.

**Issue Description:**

The repository faces an issue with `res.clearCookie()` not effectively deleting cookies due to `expires` and `maxAge` handling. Additionally, there are unresolved CI requirements and branch discrepancies impacting the merge process.
