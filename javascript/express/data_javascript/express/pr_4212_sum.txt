This pull request addresses the handling of HTTP status codes in the repository. The modifications include:

1. **Throwing Errors on Invalid Status Codes:**
   - A `RangeError` is thrown when the status code is less than 100 or greater than 999, aligning with Node.js behavior.
   - A `TypeError` is thrown if the status code is not an integer, including string representations of integers.
   - Status codes with non-integer floats (e.g., `500.5`) will cause errors, though `500.00` is allowed since it is equivalent to `500`.

2. **Status Code Range Adjustment:**
   - The acceptable status code range is refined from 1xx to 5xx, departing from Node.js' broader range.

3. **Internal Use of `res.status`:**
   - The code now internally uses `res.status` when setting status codes to apply internal validation logic.

4. **Test and Documentation Updates:**
   - Tests are updated to reflect and validate these changes, with `iojs` logic removed as it is not supported in v5.
   - The v5 documentation needs updating to mirror these changes (handled in a separate PR).

5. **Version and Branch Adjustments:**
   - The PR branch was reparented from master to 5.x, targeting the 5.x branch for these changes.

Make sure to verify all tests are accurate to these changes and clean up tests. This PR is marked as draft until all tasks are complete.
