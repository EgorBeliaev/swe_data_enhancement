**Instruction for Changes:**

Replace all instances of `String.prototype.substr()` with `String.prototype.slice()` or `String.prototype.substring()` in the codebase, as `substr()` is deprecated. Use `slice()` or `substring()` based on which method logically fits the context, as both are not deprecated and offer similar functionality.
