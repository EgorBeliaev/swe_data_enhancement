**Instructions for Updating `merge-descriptors` Dependency:**

1. **Objective**: Upgrade the `merge-descriptors` dependency version in the `package.json`. The current version is 9 years old, and the aim is to allow patch updates to address deduplication issues when newer versions are installed by other dependencies.

2. **Branch `4.x`**:
   - Update the `merge-descriptors` dependency to version `1.0.3`.
   - Maintain the fixed version policy as per the existing project guidelines.

3. **Branch `5.x`**:
   - Update the dependency to version `2.x`, which requires Node.js 18 or higher.
   - Change the versioning policy to accept minor updates (use `^` prefix).

**Note**: The PR for version `5.x` has been created under #5782, and there is an ongoing discussion about the merging delay.
