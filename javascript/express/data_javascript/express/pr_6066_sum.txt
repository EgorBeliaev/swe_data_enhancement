**Instructions:**

1. Refactor the parameter parsing by replacing the current split-based approach with a loop to enhance performance.
2. Consider using `indexOf` instead of an additional split for improved performance, if readability by splitting on `;` is preferred.
3. Evaluate removing unnecessary `slices` and `trim` operations for additional performance gains, though it might be excessive for this function.
4. If the code's usage is limited to the specified lines in `lib/response.js`, avoid exporting these utilities to users. Instead, directly return the `value` to bypass further processing.
5. Consider backporting these changes to version 4 as suggested.
   
Issue being fixed: This PR aims to optimize the parsing of parameters to improve performance and potentially simplify the codebase by reducing unnecessary operations and limiting public exposure of utility functions if not needed.
