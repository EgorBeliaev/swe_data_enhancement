**Instruction for Change:**

- **Objective:** Remove the unused `originalIndex` from the `acceptParams` function in `express/lib/utils.js`.
- **Reasoning:** The `originalIndex` property is always `undefined` and isn't utilized in a meaningful way. Although the parameter is technically accessible if doing a deep require and calling `normalizeType` directly, it does not produce any tangible output, and its removal is extremely unlikely to break external code.
- **Note:** While traditionally functions in `utils` might be frozen due to external usage, `acceptParams` is not an exported function and thus not subject to these constraints.
