**Change Instructions for `res.clearCookie`:**

1. **Deprecation Notice:**
   - Implement a deprecation warning in the application when a truthy value is passed for `options.maxAge` or `options.expires` within the `res.clearCookie(name, options)` function.
   - Example warning message: 
     > "res.clearCookie: Passing "options.maxAge" is deprecated and should be removed. Starting with the next major release of Express, this option will be ignored, as res.clearCookie will automatically set cookies to expire immediately. Please update your code to omit this option."

2. **Purpose of Change:**
   - This change addresses and closes issue [#5640](https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/5640).
   - Ensures the express framework prepares for the next major release where `res.clearCookie` will default the cookie expiration to immediate when clearing cookies, thus making the `maxAge` and `expires` options irrelevant.
  
3. **Related Context:**
   - This PR is related to a previously discussed issue #4852 within the repository.

**Note:** Ensure all updates follow backward compatibility until the next major release to facilitate smooth transition for current users.
