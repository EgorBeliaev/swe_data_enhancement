**Instruction for Changes:**

Increase the Mocha test timeout to 7500ms in response to timeout issues in the CI environment, particularly on low-end hardware. This adjustment primarily targets the test related to memory allocation mentioned in the linked issue. If other tests are affected, further investigation will be conducted. Ensure this update is tested to confirm the fix resolves the CI test run issues without additional test failures.
