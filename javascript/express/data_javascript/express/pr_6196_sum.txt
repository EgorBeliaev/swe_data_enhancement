**Instruction**: Replace the `methods` dependency from the project with calls to the standard library using `require('node:http').METHODS`. This change is necessary because the `methods` package primarily serves as a polyfill for older Node.js versions that are no longer supported. This PR contributes towards closing issue #4282, and since we no longer support Node.js versions earlier than 18, it is safe to proceed with this update.
