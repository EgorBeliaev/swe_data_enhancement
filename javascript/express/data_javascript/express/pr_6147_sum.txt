**Instruction:**

With the minimum supported Node.js version set to v18, remove the AsyncLocalStorage support check since it was introduced in v13.10.0 and v12.17.0. Additionally, ensure to manually update the `HISTORY.md` file to reflect this code change, as automation for such updates is not yet implemented.
