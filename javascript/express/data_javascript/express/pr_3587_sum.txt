**Issue Resolution:**

- Modify `res.format()` to invoke all handlers, including the `default` handler, with the same context (`this`) as the format object. This ensures consistency across all handler invocations.

**Code Changes:**

1. Adjust `res.format` so that the `default` handler is called with the format object (`this`) as the context, similar to non-default handlers.
2. Consider passing the format object also as an additional argument, making it available both via `this` and as an argument in all handlers.

**Testing:**

- Ensure that a test case is added where `default` and non-default handlers function correctly with access to the format object through `this`.
