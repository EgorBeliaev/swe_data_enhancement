**Instruction for PR Implementation:**

1. **Remove unnecessary require statement**: 
   - Eliminate the explicit require for the global `Buffer` in the codebase, as it is globally available in Node.js and does not need to be explicitly required.

2. **Update History File**:
   - Add an entry to `history.md` to document the removal of the unnecessary `require` statement for the global `Buffer`. This ensures the change is noted in the release notes.
