**Instructions:**

1. Modify `res.download()` to resolve the filename to an absolute path only when `options.root` is not set.
2. Ensure that any changes are non-breaking as per the code suggestion in issue #4834.
3. Verify the implementation by adding a test covering the change. Note that `res.download()` relies on `res.sendFile()`, so the existing tests for various cases with `root` in options in `sendFile` should cover the new changes.
4. Run the linter to ensure code quality and consistency.
