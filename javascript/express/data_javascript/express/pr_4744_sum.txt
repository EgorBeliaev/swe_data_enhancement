**Instructions:**

- Ensure that `res.json` returns a JSON response even when called with falsy values like `undefined` by guarding against `undefined` before using `String.replace()`.
- Add a test for `res.json` with the "json escape" setting to validate that it doesn't return `text/html` in such cases.
- Apply the similar fix to `res.jsonp` and include an additional test to ensure it handles falsy values correctly. 
- Rebase these changes onto the `master` branch, incorporating both the fix and the tests.
