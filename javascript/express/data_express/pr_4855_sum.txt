### Instruction for Programmer:

Implement a change to `res.download()` that modifies its behavior to resolve the filename to an absolute path **only when** `options.root` is **not set**. This adjustment addresses the issue mentioned in #4834 regarding abnormal root behavior. Ensure completion of the following tasks:

1. Ensure that the change does not break existing functionality.
2. Add a test to cover this change, focusing on scenarios where `options.root` is not used (rely on `res.sendFile()` tests for cases involving `options.root`).
3. Run a linter to verify code conformity to style guidelines.
