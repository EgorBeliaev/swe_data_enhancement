**Instructions for Repository Update:**

1. **Upgrade Dependency:**
   - Upgrade `depd` to version `2.0.0` as part of the changes in PR #4171.

2. **Plan for Future Versions:**
   - Note that `setprototypeof` is already handled in #4011.
   - Decide on moving `depd` to version 5.0, although not explicitly advised by the main author, Doug Wilson.

3. **Ensure Dependency Compatibility:**
   - Upgrade `http-errors` as part of updating sub-dependencies. This will bump its major version but won't affect the major version of Express dependencies.

4. **Address Security Concerns:**
   - Investigate switching `depd` dependency to a more actively maintained fork to allow enabling the `--disallow-code-generation-from-strings` option for improved server security.
   - Follow up on unresolved pull requests in the `depd` repo that aim to remove `eval` and `new Function`.

5. **Communication and Maintenance:**
   - Ensure repository subscription is active to keep track of updates and issues related to `depd`.

**Core Issue:**
The PR aims to improve the `depd` dependency by removing `eval` and enhancing security, which is critical for allowing a safer server option to be turned on. Follow up on stalled improvements related to security enhancements within the `depd` module.
