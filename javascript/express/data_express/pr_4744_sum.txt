### Instruction to Programmer:

1. **Replace Incorrect Response Type**: Ensure that when the "json escape" setting is used, `res.json` returns `application/json` even when called with falsy values such as `undefined`. This involves guarding against `undefined` values from `JSON.stringify()` before applying `String.replace()`.

2. **Add Test for `res.jsonp`**: Incorporate a test for the `res.jsonp` method, ensuring it correctly handles cases similar to `res.json` with the "json escape" setting.

3. **Rebase on Master**: Rebase your fix onto the `master` branch along with the additional test for `res.jsonp`. 

This PR resolves an issue where `res.json` was incorrectly returning `text/html` instead of `application/json` when given falsy values.
