        "body": "The use of `!~` hides the completely understandable `apiKeys.indexOf(key) < 0` or `if(!apiKeys.includes(key))`.\r\nSince this is example code, this should be crisp and clean. \r\nI don't see any advantage or improvement in the use of a \"bitwise negation of -1 is 0 and thus falsy, so I can use a boolean not on it for my if statement\" to replace a straight \"result is less than 0\". I even would consider it is slower than a simple compare, since it's two operations. The newer API (includes) is even more literate in coding style. \r\nI suggest this is fixed."
