**Instruction for Change:**

Refactor the code to prefix all built-in Node.js module imports. This change leverages Node.js >=18 features to:

1. Clearly define the boundary between built-in and external dependencies.
2. Minimize the risk of accidentally importing external dependencies when a built-in is intended.
3. Enhance compatibility with other JavaScript runtimes that provide Node.js compatibility, although the impact is mostly during development.

This modification is not functionally necessary as Node.js prioritizes built-in modules. However, it aligns with emerging best practices and improves code clarity. Ensure that the refactor does not affect existing imports of newly added built-in modules that conflict with user-defined modules.
