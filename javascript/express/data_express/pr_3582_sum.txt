**Instruction:**

1. **Enhance Error Handling:** Modify the `sendFile` function to provide a clearer error message when an invalid path type is passed. Specifically, ensure that the error message reads "path must be string" when the path is not a valid string.

2. **Add Test Case:** Implement a test to cover the scenario where a non-string object is passed to `sendFile` (e.g., `sendFile({})`). Verify that this results in the expected error message "path must be string".

3. **Verify Tests:** Ensure all tests pass and confirm compatibility post-implementation by running the full test suite.

4. **Rebuild if Necessary:** If any unrelated build failures occur, restart and ensure all builds complete successfully, following the practice of rerunning failed jobs as indicated.
