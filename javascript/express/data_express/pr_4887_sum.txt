**Instruction:**

Increase the Mocha test timeout to 7500ms to address timeout issues on low-end hardware, as specified in the PR. This change is specifically needed to prevent the `should not stack overflow with many registered routes` test from timing out, as this test takes approximately 3700ms to complete. The new timeout setting should allow this test to pass consistently on various platforms, especially on aarch64 systems where issues were identified.

**Additional Context:**
- The specific test causing issues was identified, and increasing the timeout to 7500ms allows for successful completion.
- This change should be isolated to this test only if possible, per the discussion in the PR.
- The CI test configuration cancels after the first failure, so further verification on Monday will be needed to ensure other tests are not affected before confirming this as a final solution.
