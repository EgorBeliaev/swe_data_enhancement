Upgrade the `merge-descriptors` dependency in `package.json`:

1. For the 4.x branch, update the version to `1.0.3`.
2. For the 5.x branch, change the dependency to allow minors (`^` prefix) and use version v2, which requires Node 18 and higher.

Two separate pull requests are needed:  
- One PR against `master` for the 4.x update.  
- One PR against `5.x` for the minor version acceptance and upgrade to v2.
