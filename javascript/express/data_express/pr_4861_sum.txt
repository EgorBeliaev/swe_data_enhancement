**Instruction for Programmer:**

Update the following properties in the app using an object with a null prototype for better optimization and security:
1. Change `app.cache`, `app.engines`, and `app.settings` from being initialized with `{}` to `Object.create(null)`.
2. Ensure that `app.locals` is also created using `Object.create(null)` as verified by the added test.

Additionally, the merge conflicts in the PR have been resolved and it is ready for final review and merging. Ensure all tests pass after these changes.
