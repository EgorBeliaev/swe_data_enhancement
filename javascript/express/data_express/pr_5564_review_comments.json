        "body": "## The Issue\r\n\r\nThe combination of running on all PR and all Push rn means that if a maintainer creates a branch just for a PR, but pushes the branch to `origin` instead of their `upstream` fork, we will run CI twice.\r\n\r\nAn example of the duplicated runs can be seen on this PR:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5562\r\n\r\nIt ran 48 status checks, which is all 24 in the CI job x2. One for the push event and one for the PR event:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"599\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-25 at 10 20 23\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/expressjs/express/assets/12915163/3a83aac3-04ae-4868-84d1-b607c2e72326\">\r\n\r\nThis is wasteful of CI time, but also likely not intended behavior.\r\n\r\n## The Change\r\n> Note: none of these changes would impact the Windows tests configured through appveyor, the status of which we can tackle elsewhere\r\n\r\n### Only run CI for push events on select branches\r\nWe'll still run on all PRs, this limits only our runs triggered by pushes to branches on `origin`.\r\n\r\nFor selected branches I added:\r\n\r\n* `master`\r\n* `develop` \r\n* `4.x`\r\n* `5.x` \r\n\r\nWe could try a glob for versions instead, but this should be fine until we need that. \r\n\r\n### Skip CI if the change is only to `.md` files\r\n\r\nWe don't lint md currently, so if a PR only changes md, no need to run any of our ci jobs\r\n\r\n### Manage concurrency\r\n\r\nLeverages github actions concurrency group feature to stop any workflows for a given PR or HEAD if a newer trigger is run for that same PR or HEAD. Essentially dedupes, ensuring only the newest changes are fully run.\r\n"
