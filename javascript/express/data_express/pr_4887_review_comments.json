        "body": "Yes, the rest of the CI works nicely with this timeout. With the here provided fix, the following test runs completes without any errors:\r\n\r\n    npm config set shrinkwrap false && npm rm --silent --save-dev connect-redis && npm run test-ci\r\n\r\nThe `should not stack overflow with many registered routes` test clocks in at `~3700ms`, therefore we doubled this duration and came up with the suggested 7 seconds.\r\n\r\nImportant: Since the CI test runs cancels after the first failure, I cannot comment if other tests are not affected yet. Will look on Monday at the logs and try to determine if other tests are affected as well."
