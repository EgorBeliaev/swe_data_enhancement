So this should not block anything.\r\n\r\nAs for this, if you could add this to the history file under `unreleased changes` that would be awesome. Not a big deal, but I forgot to ask for it on a few commits and so am trying to remember."

According to [this discussion](https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5595#issuecomment-2050179731), we are expected to clearly mark such changes in our commits.\r\n\r\nShould I mark this as a breaking change using the **Conventional Commits** `BREAKING CHANGE` convention?\r\n"
