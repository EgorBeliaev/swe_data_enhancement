**Instruction for Programmer:**

Remove the `--bail` option from the test script in the codebase. The original intent was for `--bail` to be used only during local development; however, it unintentionally became part of the CI process due to a script reuse. This option causes the test execution to stop after the first failure, which is not ideal for CI. Instead of altering the CI script to include a parameter like `-- --bail=false`, it's recommended to remove `--bail` altogether for consistent test behavior across environments.
