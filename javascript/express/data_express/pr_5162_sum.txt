**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Use Random Port in Tests**: Modify tests to use port `0` instead of a fixed port `9999` to ensure they do not fail when the port is already in use on a machine. This addresses the issue where Docker Desktop or other applications may occupy port `9999`.

2. **Add Specific Port Listening Test**: Include a test case to verify that the application listens on a specified port `x` when provided as a parameter.

3. **Remove Promises for Node.js Compatibility**: Ensure that the new tests do not utilize `Promise`s to maintain compatibility with older versions of Node.js.

4. **Investigate Appveyor Failure**: Check the Appveyor CI for a failure not related to the changes in this PR. If necessary, trigger a rerun to verify whether the failure persists.

These steps should ensure the robustness of the test suite by allowing flexibility in port usage and maintaining broad compatibility across Node.js versions.
