**Instruction for Changes:**

Refactor the `acceptParams` function by replacing the current method of array splitting and iteration with a loop to enhance performance. Instead of splitting further, use `indexOf`. Consider removing unnecessary slices and `trim` operations for additional optimization, keeping in mind practicality versus performance gain. Given the limited internal use of the code, avoid exporting these utilities to users and simply return `value` to bypass extensive processing. Evaluate necessity for backporting these changes to version 4.
