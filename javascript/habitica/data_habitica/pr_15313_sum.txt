### Instructions:

1. **Modify the User Fetch Operation:**
   - Ensure that the `purchased.plan` field is included when retrieving user records for task scoring to account for subscribers.

2. **Implement Tests for Drop Scenarios:**
   - Add four test cases to validate the drop receiving logic:
     1. Verify that a user receives a drop.
     2. Confirm a non-subscriber does not receive a drop if they have reached the drop cap.
     3. Check that a subscriber receives a drop when they are above the regular drop cap but within the subscriber cap.
     4. Ensure a subscriber does not receive a drop if they have reached the subscriber drop cap.

3. **Handle Randomness in Tests:**
   - Use `Math.random` stubbing for controlling randomness in the drop system where `predictableRandom` is not effective.

### Issue Being Fixed:

Subscribers were previously not receiving the intended benefits in item drops due to the `purchased.plan` field being omitted during task scoring operations. This update corrects that oversight, ensuring subscribers can receive all drops owed to them.
