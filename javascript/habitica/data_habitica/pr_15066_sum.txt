**Issue & Proposed Changes:**

The issue being addressed in this PR is related to the sorting options in the party member list when using a transformation item. Initially, the sorting method was not returning a modified array, which resulted in the dropdown menu not functioning as expected.

**Specific Changes:**

1. **Sorting Fix:**
   - Modify the existing sorting method to ensure it returns a properly sorted array instead of the unmodified one.

2. **Search Functionality Enhancement:**
   - Implement the search function from the "View Party" modal into the party member selection modal. This ensures that the search field is functional when selecting a party member for transformation item usage.
