### Instruction for Programmer:

Ensure that party chat messages for seasonal transformations (e.g., Shiny Seed, Snowball) correctly display separate messages for different targets:

1. **Do Not Collapse Messages:**
   - Avoid collapsing messages into a single report when different targets are affected.

2. **Override Message Conditions:**
   - Only overwrite and update messages if:
     - The same user is performing the action ("casting" a skill or using an item).
     - The target remains the same:
       - Either targeting the entire party.
       - Or targeting the same individual user when using items designed for single targets. 

Implement these changes to ensure clarity and accuracy in reporting spell or item usage notifications in the party chat system.
