The Pull Request requests copying the "Pause Damage" button to the Settings page. However, the text associated with the button is already available under the existing token "pauseDailies" in `website/common/locales/en/npc.json`. It should use this existing token for consistency and reusability, unless there's a justification for two different translations. Therefore, the instruction for the programmer is:

- Modify the implementation to reuse the existing "pauseDailies" token for the "Pause Damage" button text instead of adding a new token "sleepHeader".
