**Instruction for Changes:**

Ensure that for all GET requests fetching tasks, the `id` field is always included, and the internal `__v` field is removed, irrespective of the query parameter used (`type=completedTodos` or any other). Adjust the logic to perform these actions at an earlier point in the processing code.
