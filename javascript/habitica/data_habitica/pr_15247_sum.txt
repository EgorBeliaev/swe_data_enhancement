### Instructions for Change

**Title:** Fix intro guide  

**Description:**  
Resolve the error "invalid instanceof window.jQuery" occurring in the intro.js module by using `webpack.ProvidePlugin` to make `window.jQuery` available globally.  

**Files and Changes:**  
- **File Affected:** `client/vue.config.js`  
  - **Add the Code Below:**  
    ```javascript
    const webpackPlugins = [
      new webpack.ProvidePlugin({'window.jQuery': 'jquery'}),
      new webpack.DefinePlugin(envObject),
      new webpack.ContextReplacementPlugin(/moment[\\/](locale)$/, /^\\.\\/(NOT_EXISTING)$/),
    ];
    ```

**Additional Notes:**
- The error occurs in both dev and production builds, but in dev mode it's displayed on the screen, while in production it's only visible in the console.
- The intro.js module doesn't declare jQuery as a peerDependency and assumes `window.jQuery` to be globally available, which is addressed using `webpack.ProvidePlugin`.
