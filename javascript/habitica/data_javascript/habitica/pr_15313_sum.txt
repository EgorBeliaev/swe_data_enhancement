**Issue**: Subscribers were not receiving their entitled drop benefits during task scoring because the `purchased.plan` field was missing in the user record retrieval.

**Instructions**:

1. **Include `purchased.plan` Field**: Ensure that the `purchased.plan` field is retrieved when fetching user records for task scoring. This will allow subscribers to receive their entitled drop benefits.

2. **Testing Consideration**: Address the inability to use `sinon.stub` on `common.fns.predictableRandom`. As a workaround, Phillip Thelen has successfully stubbed `Math.random` for test scenarios, which is utilized by the drop system. Incorporate this approach to facilitate testing drop scenarios. 

3. **Implement Tests**: Apply the patch provided by Phillip Thelen, which includes the following test cases:
   - A user successfully receives a drop.
   - A non-subscriber does not receive a drop if they have reached the drop cap.
   - A subscriber receives a drop if they exceed the regular drop cap but are under the subscriber limit.
   - A subscriber does not receive a drop when they are at the subscriber drop cap.

These changes and tests address the issue of incorrect drop distribution and ensure subscribers receive the benefits they are owed.
