**Instruction for the Programmer:**

Implement a fix for issue #13542 to ensure that the help text in the task column is not obscured by the rewards list. Update the overlay-checking logic to consider the total height of both tasks and reward cards, not just tasks. Ensure that the help text is only hidden when necessary, taking into account both task and reward cards. This involves recalculating the total height with mixed card types to appropriately manage the display of the help text.
