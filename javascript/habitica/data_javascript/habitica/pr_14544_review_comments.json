        "body": "This PR contains the following optimisations for accessing the database:\r\n\r\n1. Fixes the middleware loading order, so that the server doesn't have to make an extra db request on every load to get the users language\r\n2. when requesting a guild that doesn't exist, we don't always have to update the user object\r\n3. loads less fields for party members when using skills\r\n4. Bulk update party members when using skills\r\n\r\nThis should overall significantly reduce the number of queries the server makes to the database."
