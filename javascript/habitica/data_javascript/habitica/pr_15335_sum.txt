**Instructions:**

1. Update the class avatars to display the class's best "basic" gear instead of Gala gear in the select class modal.
2. Adjust the alignment of avatars so they are centered and remain stationary when selected.
3. Change CSS selectors from `em` to `px` where needed, specifically for margins and padding.
