### Instruction for Changes:

1. **Modify Task Fetch Logic**:
   - Ensure the `id` field is included in the response for all GET requests for tasks, regardless of the query parameter used.
   - Always prune the `__v` field from the database output for task fetch operations.

2. **Refactor Code Execution Order**:
   - Move the logic for adding the `id` and stripping `__v` to an earlier point in the code execution. This should be applied universally to both active tasks and completed To Do's retrieval.
