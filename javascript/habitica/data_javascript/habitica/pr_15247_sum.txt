**Instruction for Changes:**

1. **File Modified**: `client/vue.config.js`
2. **Modification**:
   - Add a new Webpack plugin to the `webpackPlugins` array:
     ```javascript
     new webpack.ProvidePlugin({'window.jQuery': 'jquery'}),
     ```

**Issue Description**:
The issue being fixed is an error with the intro guide that occurs due to the module `intro.js` assuming that `window.jQuery` is available globally. The error manifests as "invalid instanceof window.jquery". The solution involves using Webpack's `ProvidePlugin` to ensure `jQuery` is globally available, which resolves the error in both development and production environments.
