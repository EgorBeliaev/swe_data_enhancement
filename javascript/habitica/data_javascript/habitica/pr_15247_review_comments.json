        "body": "@negue **Thanks, your comment made my day.** \r\nTaking this opportunity, I'll explain what happened here, as it might help in deciding whether my solution is the most appropriate. The problem is with the intro.js module. Despite the fact that it uses jQuery, it doesn't include it as a peerDependency and doesn't import jQuery in its files, it simply assumes that window.jQuery will be available on the page. Adding jQuery in webpack.ProvidePlugin results in webpack automatically importing jQuery in the modules that use it during the build."

It's just that in production mode, runtime errors are not displayed on the screen, but you will see the same error in the console.
