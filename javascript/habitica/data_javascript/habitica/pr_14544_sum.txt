Optimize database access by implementing the following changes:

1. Adjust middleware loading order to eliminate the need for an extra database request to retrieve the user's language on every server load.
2. Optimize guild requests by avoiding unnecessary user object updates when a non-existent guild is queried.
3. Reduce the number of fields loaded for party members during skill usage.
4. Implement bulk updates for party members when skills are used to decrease the number of database queries.
