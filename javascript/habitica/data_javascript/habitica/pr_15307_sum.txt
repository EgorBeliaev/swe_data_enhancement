### Instructions for Changes

1. **Update Event Dates and Times**: Ensure world event dates and times are consistent throughout the repository.
2. **Include Gem Promos and G1G1**: Add gem promotions and G1G1 to the list of repeating world events.
3. **Modify Test Date**: Change the faked date in the test file (`events.test.js`) from January 6th to January 8th.
4. **Address Failing Tests**:
   - For tests expecting 1 event but receiving 2, adjust expected numbers to 2.
   - For tests that fail because no events are supposed to be returned, set a later date for checking.

These changes ensure updated and correct handling of world events and related tests in the repository.
