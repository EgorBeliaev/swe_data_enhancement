See https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4937 for an example.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the glob dependency to 8.1.0 which no longer depends on the insecure version of minimatch."

Additionally, I got an error during linting that   \"eslint-plugin-n\" is missing. I though it was my local setup, but it also happened when the tests ran in the CI process. Anyways, I added that package to the dev deps. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns "
