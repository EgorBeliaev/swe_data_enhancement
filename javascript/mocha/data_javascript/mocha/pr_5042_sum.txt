The PR focuses on integrating `knip` to validate included dependencies within the repository. The following tasks have been identified and addressed:

1. The `nps` removal, `husky` update/replacement, and alternative to `validate-conventional-commit` have been split into their own PRs, specifically #5126, #5124, and #5077 respectively.
2. Ensure this PR focuses solely on incorporating `knip`.
3. Rebase the PR until it passes validation and is ready to merge.
4. Dependencies within `package.json` such as `@11ty/eleventy`, `@mocha/docdash`, and others need attention as they were flagged during validation.
5. After merging PR #5128, this PR is now ready. Confirm that all the issues from the above dependencies list are resolved.
6. A minor decrease in test coverage was noted (-0.002%). Ensure test coverage remains robust.

These instructions should guide incremental updates to the repository as outlined by this PR.
