### Instruction to Programmer:

**Title:** `feat: highlight browser failures`

**Objective:**
Implement visual indicators for test pass/fail status in the browser UI.

**Tasks:**
1. **Change Pass Indicator:**
   - Update the pass indicator to an accessible dark green color when in light mode.

2. **Fail Indicator:**
   - Add a red fail indicator as soon as a test fails.
   - Change the color of the "failures" text to red when a test fails.

3. **Pass Indicator:**
   - Once all tests have completed and there are no failures, add a green pass indicator.
   - Change the color of the "passes" text to green when all tests pass.

4. **Root Suite Result Indicators:**
   - Ensure result indicators for the root suite mirror those for individual tests.
   - Display only pass/fail for the root suite; show `pass` for `skip` to simplify.

**Note:** 
- This is a UI-only change aiming to enhance the accessibility and clarity of test results with color-coded indicators.
- Visual examples are provided for both dark and light mode scenarios to guide implementation.

**Issue References:**
- Fixes #792
- Works on #5129
