**Instruction for Programmer:**

- Address the crash issue when both `--parallel` and `--retries` are enabled (related to issue #5170).
- Ensure that the change is compliant with the project's contribution guidelines, as stated in CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Investigate and modify the circular-reference-breaking logic (introduced in #5032) to correctly apply solely to `result.error`, avoiding unintended effects on other `result` properties.
- Verify the absence of existing tests for this specific scenario and consider adding them to ensure robustness.
