Title: Fix support for errors with circular dependencies in object values with --parallel

Summary of Changes:

1. **Fix Circular Dependencies**: Update the error serialization process by introducing a `seenPairs` `Set` to ensure circular references in non-error properties of the `result` object are serialized only once, thereby preventing infinite addition to `pairs`. This addresses issue #5209.

2. **Property Write Restriction**: Modify property writes to only occur on properties with `.writable` descriptors, resolving issue #5188.

Additional Notes:
- The PR addresses and fixes the open issues #5188 and #5209. 
- Test failures on Node 22 were noted to happen on the `main` branch as well, and a separate issue was filed as #5213.
- The merge was expedited due to inactivity from other maintainers. 

Please ensure the implemented logic aligns with the described fixes to the issues specified.
