The pull request aims to fix inaccurate test links in the HTML reporter of the Mocha repository. The issue arises when links intended for specific suites or tests inadvertently match unrelated ones. To address this, the following changes are outlined:

1. **Suite Links**: Add '^' and ' ' at the beginning and end, respectively, to ensure links for a suite like `Case1` do not erroneously match `Case10 test1`.
   
2. **Test Links**: Add '^' and '$' at the beginning and end, respectively, to ensure links for a test like `CSS` do not inadvertently match `should fix invalid CSS`.

These adjustments aim to improve the HTML reporter's accuracy in matching suite and test links with the correct targets. Note that despite standard procedure, UI-related changes in this pull request do not include automated tests due to the absence of existing related tests and the complexity of adding headless browser testing infrastructure.
