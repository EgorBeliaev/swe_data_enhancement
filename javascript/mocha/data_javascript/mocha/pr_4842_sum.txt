**Instruction to Programmer:**

1. Fix the error handling within the third-party reporter integration:
   - Modify `_lib/cli/run-helpers.js_` to correct the CLI plugin entry point.
   - Update `_lib/mocha.js_` to fix and simplify the `reporter()` function when used programmatically via the Mocha API.

2. Make necessary adjustments to:
   - The existing tests to accommodate code changes.
   - The webpack configuration for compatibility with the new changes.

3. Ensure the implementation closes the issue #3596 related to the misdiagnosis of reporter errors.
