Implement the following change:

- Remove the `@ungap/promise-all-settled` polyfill from the codebase.
- Update the code to use the native `Promise.allSettled` method, which is supported in Node.js 12.9.0 and later.
- Ensure that all instances where the polyfill was used are replaced with the native method, as Node.js 14+ is now supported.

Note: This change reduces dependencies in the project.
