**Instruction for Repository Programmer:**

1. **Remove Tests from `prepublishOnly`:** The `prepublishOnly` script currently runs tests including `test-browser` that attempt to execute on Sauce Labs, causing the build to fail. These tests should be removed from this script as they are already managed by other GitHub Action jobs.

2. **Reference an Issue:** Update the pull request description to reference a specific issue number using the format "Fixes #XYZ" or "Resolves #XYZ", ensuring compliance with the PR requirements outlined in the Contributing Guide.
