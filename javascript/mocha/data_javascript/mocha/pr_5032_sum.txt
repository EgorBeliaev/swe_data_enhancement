### Issue Description:
The PR addresses the issue of "Uncaught TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON" occurring in parallel mode when circular references are present in the objects being serialized. This error is especially prevalent in cases like missing module dependencies in NestJS, causing cryptic errors.

### Changes to be Made:
1. **Improve Error Serialization**:
   - Implement a mechanism to break circular references in objects before they are serialized.
   - Ensure that when errors with circular structures are detected, they are handled gracefully to prevent the TypeError.

2. **Maintain Essential Error Properties**:
   - Consider retaining standard error properties like `message`, `name`, and `stack` while removing additional properties to prevent information loss.

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Be aware that inspecting objects for circular references could introduce a performance penalty, however, it should not be significant.

### Additional Notes:
- **Test and Debug**: Ensure comprehensive testing to confirm that the fix doesn't introduce new issues or regressions, like the one mentioned in issue #5188.
- **Monitoring Impact**: Keep an eye on reports related to the recent fix in release `mocha@10.5.2` to address any unforeseen side effects or exceptions.

### Release Specifics:
- This change is intended as a fix/patch release as indicated in the PR discussions, which corresponds to issue #4552.
