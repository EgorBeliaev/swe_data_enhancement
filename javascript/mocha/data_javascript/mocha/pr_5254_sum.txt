**Instructions to Programmer:**

1. **Objective**: Update the repository to handle exceptions during the setting of `Error.stackTraceLimit` when Node is executed with the `--frozen-intrinsics` flag.
   
2. **Modification**: Implement a mechanism to catch the `TypeError` caused by modifying intrinsic objects, log the exception for debugging purposes, and allow the program to continue executing without exiting due to an uncaught exception.

3. **Testing Note**: Running tests with `--frozen-intrinsics` is currently problematic because of a dependency on `unexpected` and its dependency `unexpected-bluebird`, which are not compatible.

4. **Versioning**: This change should be considered a bugfix, warranting a patch-level version bump. Merge this after the release of Mocha version 11 to align with their branching strategy and ensure compatibility with upcoming releases.

5. **Additional Considerations**: While Mocha will fix its support for `--frozen-intrinsics`, it is acknowledged that the responsibility for full compatibility under this flag also lies with test dependencies in the future.
