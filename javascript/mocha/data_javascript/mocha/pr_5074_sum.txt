The pull request addresses an issue where TypeScript errors were not properly outputted in `lib/cli/run.js`. Previously, the system would fail and return "ERROR: null" due to a "TypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value." The fix modifies error handling to ensure that TypeScript errors, such as missing properties in types, are clearly displayed in the output. It changes the error output from "âœ– ERROR: null" to a more descriptive message, like "Undefined error: test/index.test.ts(9,44): error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'." The PR also suggests adopting a simpler error handling approach using `console.error('\n Mocha run failed:', err);` for easier maintainability. Reviewers suggest further enhancements to support `AggregateError` and `Error` causes, emphasizing this is a general error-handling improvement, not limited to TypeScript errors.
