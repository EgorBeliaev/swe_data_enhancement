**Instructions:**

1. **Update Engine Range:**
   - Modify the engine range to align with other common dev dependencies like ESLint 9.
   - Set the version range to `^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0`.

2. **Implement `release-please`:**
   - Set up `release-please` for handling pre-releases.

3. **Add `installed-check`:**
   - Include `installed-check` for validating the engine range against dependencies.
   - Run `npx installed-check --engine-check --verbose` to verify engine ranges and identify any missing declarations.

4. **Address Engine Range Strategy:**
   - Consider remaining compatible with Node.js 18, per the original proposal.
   - Evaluate the implications of updating to Node.js 16 or 18 based on available data.
   - If time is limited for further investigation, default to updating to Node.js 18 for simplicity.

These changes aim to facilitate modern dependency support while minimizing user disruption.
