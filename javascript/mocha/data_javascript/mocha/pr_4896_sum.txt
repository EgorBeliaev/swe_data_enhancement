This pull request adds support for a dark mode in the application by implementing CSS to handle the `prefers-color-scheme: dark` setting and some JavaScript for the progress indicator. Despite considerations of using SVG for styling the progress indicator, this change is viewed as a separate task. The addition of dark mode is motivated by the need for reduced brightness in certain environments, such as during a flight where bright screens are not ideal. Users who prefer dark mode, which is gaining popularity, will benefit from this feature. However, there is a potential drawback as browsers not supporting CSS variable `var`, like Internet Explorer, may encounter issues. This PR addresses issue #4895. The discussion also highlights testing on different operating systems, with references to macOS and Windows.
