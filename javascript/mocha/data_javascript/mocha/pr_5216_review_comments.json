        "body": "As we prepare for the next step of Mocha its time to get rid of some of the baggage that's stopping us from updating dependencies and using modern language features.\r\n\r\nAs a dev dependency that other open source projects rely on we can't be too aggressive with this bump \u2013 eg. dropping Node 20 is sadly too soon.\r\n\r\nTo make as little hassle as possible for users it makes sense to align our version range with other common dev dependencies, and one of the newest such releases is ESLint 9, which has a version range of [`^18.18.0 || ^20.9.0 || >=21.1.0`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/6d4484d9c19e4132f3dee948174a543dbbb5d30f/package.json#L199)\r\n\r\nThis PR also sets up `release-please` for pre-releases and adds `installed-check` (which I maintain) to validate the engine range against that of our dependencies (running `npx installed-check --engine-check --verbose` it shows which modules that are missing published engine ranges and which it can't check)\r\n\r\nFixes #5206"
