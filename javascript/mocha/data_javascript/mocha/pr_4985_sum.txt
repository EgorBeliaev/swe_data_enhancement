Add file path to each test case in the `xunit` reporter output, enhancing the ability to locate test files by including `file="path/to/file"` in the XML output. This change aligns `xunit` with other reporters and facilitates automated tooling for test file analysis. Consider the impact on output size and ensure no conflicts with Cypress compatibility. This update addresses issue #5112 and should be included as a minor enhancement in the next release version.
