**Issue Description for Repository:**

The PR addresses a corner case issue where the `mocha` configuration is incorrectly specified in a `package.json`. The problem arises when users:

- Have a valid `package.json` that works fine with npm.
- Add `mocha` configurations into the `package.json`.
- Leave a stray comma or similar syntax error, expecting format leniency.
- Run `mocha` directly (using `npx` or `mocha.js`) instead of `npm test`.

This leads to an error due to `mocha` encountering invalid JSON while parsing the `package.json`.

**Instructions for Programmer:**

1. Implement a fix to handle invalid JSON in the `package.json` file when configuration errors (like stray commas) occur.
2. Ensure that the fix aligns with the strategy outlined in the PR and is consistent with previous system behavior.
3. Review and adjust assertion tests to handle potential JSON parsing issues more generally, considering the requirement for handling obviously invalid JSON cases.
4. Verify that the change resolves the issue identified in #5141 in the GitHub issues for the repository.
5. Confirm and ensure CLA compliance based on the approved commits listed in the PR.
