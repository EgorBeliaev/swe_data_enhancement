**Issue**:  
The PR addresses a potential visibility problem with the test progress indicator in the Mocha HTML reporter when `HTMLCanvasElement` is not available in the browser. Without a fallback, the progress percentage is not displayed, making it difficult to track test progress.

---

**Instructions for Changes**:

1. **Replace <canvas> with Alternative Elements**:
   - Replace the `<canvas>` element used for the browser progress indicator with a combination of `<progress>` and `<svg>` elements to ensure compatibility across browsers that may not support the `HTMLCanvasElement`.
   
2. **Progress Visualization Consistency**:
   - Ensure the new implementation visually matches the existing canvas-based progress indicator in terms of approximate border widths, colors, and font styles to maintain consistency.

3. **Client Compatibility**:
   - Confirm that the new solution works for clients with limited canvas support, as noted for some specific client constraints.

4. **Code Simplification**:
   - Review the code to simplify where possible, while keeping the visual changes minimal and in line with the existing design.

5. **Update Browsing Compatibility**:
   - Consider any additional CSS transformations or non-standard features if needed to mimic rounded bar ends, while being mindful of browser version requirements.

6. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Verify the new implementation across different browsers (Edge, Firefox, Webkit) and ensure it maintains dark mode support and overall visual consistency.

7. **Documentation and Merge Prep**:
   - Update any relevant documentation to reflect changes in the progress indicator implementation.
   - Ensure the branch is merged with the latest changes from the master to resolve any conflicts before final merging.

8. **Incorporate Feedback**:
   - Ensure all feedback from PR discussions is addressed, iterating until consensus is reached.

9. **Publish Update**:
   - Once changes are complete and verified, include the update in the next release, version `mocha@10.5.0`.

**Drawbacks Noted**:
- Implementation primarily addresses a niche case, as 99% of cases support the canvas element.

**Benefits**:
- Provides a more universally compatible solution, ensuring progress visibility across more browsers without reliance on `canvas`.
