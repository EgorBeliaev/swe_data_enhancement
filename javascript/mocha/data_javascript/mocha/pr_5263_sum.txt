This pull request addresses error handling for the Mocha CLI when it encounters unexpected numeric arguments. The PR provides solutions to handle `TypeError: arg.split is not a function`. The specific changes needed include:

1. Implement a strategy for detecting invalid numeric arguments:
   - Throw a custom error when a numeric argument is passed to the CLI where a string is expected (e.g., `mocha 123`).
   - Throw a custom error when a numeric argument is used as a value for an option that does not accept numeric values (e.g., `mocha --delay 123`).

2. Ensure that errors are not thrown for numeric values passed to options that accept them (e.g., `mocha --retries 2`) or for values passed to Node.js options.

3. Improve the clarity of the error messages. Add more information to the thrown errors to aid user understanding.

4. Address any unit test changes needed to cover the new error handling logic.

5. Communicate that a nontrivial change is pending, allowing time for review by the @mochajs/maintenance-crew.

These modifications aim to enhance the robustness of argument error handling, with an emphasis on providing clear and informative error messages to users.
