**Instructions for Changes:**
1. **Error Handling Enhancement:**
   - Add validation to the `--file` option: resolve the file path to an absolute path and check for its existence.
   - Log a warning and exit if the specified file does not exist. Ensure error handling occurs in `lib/cli/run-helpers.js` during the loading of files asynchronously in the `singleRun` method.

2. **Testing:**
   - Add a unit test to verify the new error handling logic for nonexistent files with the `--file` option.

3. **Code Refactoring:**
   - Avoid embedding `process.exit` or `throw` deep within the code to prevent abrupt application exits or interruptions.
   - Introduce variable `unmatchedSpecFiles` for clarity in handling unmatched files.

4. **Documentation Update:**
   - Although noted as outside the immediate scope, update documentation to accurately reflect the capabilities of the `--file` option, removing incorrect claims about support for directories and globs.

5. **Handle Failing Tests:**
   - Fix the failing test by passing the mocha instance to the `handleUnmatchedFiles` helper function.

**Additional Notes:**
- The PR title has been updated to `fix:` to indicate a patch rather than a feature.
- The CI failure related to `netlify/mocha/deploy-preview` is a separate issue and can be disregarded in this PR.
