### Summary of Changes and Instructions:

1. **Dependency Update**:
   - Bump the `glob` version from 8 to 10 in `package.json`.
   - Ensure compatibility with Mocha 11 and Node.js versions (Mocha 11 supports Node.js 18 and up).

2. **Source Code Adjustment**:
   - Modify JavaScript source code to manually sort the results of `glob.sync` alpabetically (locale: `'en'`). This preserves the existing behavior for the order in which test files are found and executed.

3. **Testing**:
   - Confirm that all tests pass when using the updated `glob` version by explicitly testing on:
     - https://github.com/eslint/eslint
     - https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript 

### Additional Notes:
- Full upgrade to `glob@11` is currently not feasible due to Node.js version support restrictions.
- Internal repo dependencies require further updates to be clean and up-to-date, particularly in relation to the old documentation website setup. This is being tracked under issue #5207.

No other changes or refactoring should be performed as per the information provided in the JSON discussion.
