### Changes Required:

1. **Update `glob` Dependency:**
   - Upgrade the `glob` package dependency from version 7.2.0 to 8.1.0 to mitigate the dependency on the insecure `minimatch` version <=3.0.4.
  
2. **Adjust Tests:**
   - Modify tests that reference `coffee-script` (with hyphen) to `coffeescript` (without hyphen) to resolve module not found errors.

3. **Handle Missing ESLint Plugin:**
   - Address the linting issue caused by the missing "eslint-plugin-n".
   - Note that "eslint-plugin-n" serves as a peer dependency for some packages; however, higher versions of NPM may not require it to be explicitly mentioned in `package.json`.
   - Consider removing "eslint-plugin-n" if using an updated NPM version.

### Repository Issue Addressed:

- The PR addresses a security vulnerability in the `minimatch` package, which is indirectly included through the `glob` dependency of Mocha. Upgrading `glob` to version 8.1.0 resolves this security risk for end-users.
