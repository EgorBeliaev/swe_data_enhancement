The proposed changes in this PR primarily aim to allow calling hook methods like `beforeAll` to return the hook itself, similar to how calling functions like `describe` return the suite. This enhancement fixes the already filed issue #5202, which has been marked as accepting pull requests.

Instructions for programmer:
1. Implement changes to make calling hook methods such as `beforeAll` or similar functions return the hook itself.
2. Ensure that this behavior aligns with the existing behavior of functions like `describe`.
3. Add relevant tests to verify that hook methods now return the expected value (the hook itself).
4. Consider updating documentation to reflect these changes where necessary.

Note:
- Ensure to follow the guidelines in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) file during implementation.
- JoshuaKGoldberg also pointed out to remember placing `Closes #5202` in the template as an improvement for future PRs.
