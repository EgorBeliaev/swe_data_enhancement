        "body": "### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions.\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nDue to the wrong variable being referenced in `#mocha .test.fail::before`, the failed test icon (`\u2716`) is currently incorrectly colored as `#00d6b2` instead of `#cc0000` (light schema) or `#ff4444` (dark schema). See for example the screenshot posted in comment https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/4896#issuecomment-1229477806.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nn/a - this is clearly a bug fix.\r\n\r\n### Why should this be in core?\r\n\r\nn/a - this is clearly a bug fix.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nUsers may now notice test errors more easily, which makes developers, especially the UX/UI ones, happier.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nn/a - this is clearly a bug fix.\r\n\r\n### Applicable issues\r\n\r\nRegressed since https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/4896, mentioned 15 days ago (as a review comment) in https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/4896#discussion_r1008725810, but since there was no response to that, I decided to open this PR."
