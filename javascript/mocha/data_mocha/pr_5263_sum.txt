**Instructions for PR Implementation:**

1. **Error Handling Addition**:
   - Implement error handling for `TypeError: arg.split is not a function`.
   - Throw a custom error when:
     - A numeric argument is passed to the CLI (e.g., `mocha 123`).
     - A numeric argument is passed to a Mocha option that does not support numerical values (e.g., `mocha --delay 123`).
   - Ensure the error message is clear and informative.

2. **Non-numeric Argument Validity**:
   - Validate and ensure that no error is thrown if the numerical value is passed to flags that accept it (e.g., `mocha --retries 2`).
   - Validate and allow numerical values if passed to Node.js options compatible with numbers.

3. **Enhance Error Messages**:
   - Include additional contextual information in the thrown error messages to aid in debugging.

4. **Unit Testing**:
   - Develop and refine unit tests to validate the new error handling logic.

5. **Review Adjustments**:
   - Follow suggestions from peer review to optimize the invalid argument detection strategy.
   - Address any remaining stylistic discrepancies (e.g., use "numerical" consistently over "numeric").

6. **Final Review and Collaboration**:
   - If needed, request a re-review using the [re-request review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review#requesting-reviews-from-collaborators-and-organization-members) feature.
   - Await further inputs from the @mochajs/maintenance-crew for additional reviews due to the nontrivial nature of the changes.

7. **Job Execution**:
   - Investigate and address any issues causing the "netlify/mocha/deploy-preview" job to fail if applicable and permissions allow.

By addressing this PR, improve Mocha's functionality when interacting with unexpected numeric arguments in CLI operations, enhancing user experience through informative error handling.
