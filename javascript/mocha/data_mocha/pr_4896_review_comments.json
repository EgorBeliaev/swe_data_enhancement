        "body": "### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions.\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nAdds CSS to support prefers-color-scheme: dark as well as a small bit of JavaScript for the progress indicator.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nChange the progress indicator to use SVG which can by styled by CSS. But one change at a time suggests that should be a separate change.\r\n\r\n### Why should this be in core?\r\n\r\nBecause bright screens can be annoying in certain situation. The motivation for adding a dark mode was I was working on a flight. All the window shades are pulled down. All the terminals and editors I run were in dark mode but then when I went to run the tests, BOOM!, I'm lighting up all the seats around me.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nPeople who like dark mode, which is becoming fairly popular, can get mocha in dark mode.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nBrowsers that don't support CSS `var` will have issues. Basically IE\r\n\r\n### Applicable issues\r\n\r\n#4895 \r\n"
