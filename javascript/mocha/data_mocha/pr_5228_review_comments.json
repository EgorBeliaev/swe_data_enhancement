From that doc:\r\n* Please [file an issue using the feature request template](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+feature&projects=&template=03-feature-request.yml&title=%F0%9F%9A%80+Feature%3A+%3Cshort+description+of+the+feature%3E) if you have a change to propose, including a bugfix.\r\n* Unit and/or integration **tests are required** for any code change. \r\n\r\nAs maintainers looking at this PR, we don't know what bugs you're suggesting this PR will fix, why it fixes them, or what test cases would be needed to enforce that they stay fixed. I appreciate the drive to improve things in Mocha (thanks!) but please follow the contributing guide. Switching to a draft PR in the meantime."

        "body": "It should already be quite clear in the Overview section as well as in the commit message: this PR is to fix inaccurate test links for the HTML reporter, such as clicking on a link for `describe('Case1')` would get a query that hits unwanted `describe('Case10', function () { it('test1') })`, or clicking on a link for `it('CSS')` would get a query that hits unwanted `it('should fix invalid CSS')`.\r\n\r\nAs for tests: this is a UI-related change and I wonder how and what test you would like it to be? Look back the commit history, many previous changes about the reporter didn't have related tests, such as e263c7a722. If you really want a test then I think it either has to be run manually, or you'd have to implement a whole ecosystem for headless-browser related tests."
