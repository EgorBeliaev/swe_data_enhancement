**Instruction to Programmer:**

1. Modify the build process by removing `prepublishOnly` tests which were causing the build to fail due to running Saucelabs tests indirectly via the `test` and `test-browser`.
2. Ensure that tests are now handled in separate GitHub Action jobs, as per the PR description follow-up on #5186 / #5189.
3. Update the PR description to include a reference to a specific issue number using the format "Fixes #XYZ" or "Resolves #XYZ" to comply with the projectâ€™s contribution guidelines and allow for successful reopening and merging of the PR.
