**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Color Indicators for Test Results:**
   - Modify pass and fail indicators for test results to be more accessible:
     - In light mode, change the pass indicator color to dark green.
     - Introduce a red fail indicator that appears as soon as a test fails, coloring the "failures" text red.
     - Once all tests result and none fail, show a green pass indicator, coloring the "passes" text green.
   
2. **Root Suite Result Indicator:**
   - Ensure the root suite has result indicators similar to individual tests, simplifying by showing only pass/fail.
   - `Skip` results for the root suite should default to displaying `pass` for clarity.

3. **Visual Examples Provided:**
   - Refer to included images in the PR for visual representation of changes in both dark and light modes.

4. **Cleanup Unrelated Changes:**
   - Review and remove any unrelated changes to minimize the diff and improve review clarity.
