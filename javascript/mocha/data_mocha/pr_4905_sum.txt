Update the codebase to use the native `Promise.allSettled` method instead of the `@ungap/promise-all-settled` polyfill. This change is relevant as the application now supports Node.js versions 14 and above, starting from which `Promise.allSettled` is natively supported. This update will reduce dependencies without any drawbacks. Make sure old references to `Promise.allSettled` from Korean documentation are replaced with the correct English documentation link.
