### Instructions for Implementation:

1. **Support for Dark Mode:**
   - Implement CSS to support `prefers-color-scheme: dark`.
   - Implement a small amount of JavaScript for the progress indicator.

2. **Testing Requirements:**
   - Ensure new CSS and JavaScript are tested, particularly in environments that support dark mode.
   - Verify that the implementation works correctly on macOS, which was mentioned as a tested platform.

3. **Documentation and Support:**
   - Add documentation explaining how to set the dark mode and how to override any related settings.
   - Consider the behavior and appearance on different systems, such as Windows and Chrome, and ensure consistency across platforms.

4. **Contributions and CLA:**
   - Confirm that all code contributors are listed under a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

5. **Follow-up Actions:**
   - Set the appropriate labels, milestones, and close relevant issues post-merge to maintain repository organization.
   - Issues like #4895 should be reviewed for relevance and closure if resolved by this PR.

6. **Drawbacks and Compatibility:**
   - Be aware of compatibility issues with browsers that do not support CSS variables, notably Internet Explorer.

This PR addresses the issue of bright screens by adding dark mode support, which is increasingly popular and beneficial for working in dim environments.
