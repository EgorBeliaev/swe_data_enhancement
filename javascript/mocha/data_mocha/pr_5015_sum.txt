Title: "Use `<progress>` and `<svg>` for browser progress indicator instead of `<canvas>`"

Issue: The HTML reporter in Mocha currently relies on the `<canvas>` element for displaying progress indicators. This can be problematic as `<canvas>` may not be available in all environments, resulting in no visible progress bar.

Instructions:
1. Replace the existing `<canvas>` usage for progress indicators with `<progress>` and `<svg>` elements to ensure compatibility with all browsers.
2. Maintain the same visual appearance as the previous `<canvas>` implementation, including border widths, colors, and font styles.
3. Incorporate text as a fallback in case `<progress>` or `<svg>` fail to render correctly.
4. Ensure the solution supports dark mode improvements.
5. Simplify the code where possible to improve maintainability.
6. Avoid introducing new dependencies by maintaining existing visual styles without major redesigns.

The goal is to provide a robust and consistent progress display across all supported browsers while reducing reliance on `<canvas>`.
