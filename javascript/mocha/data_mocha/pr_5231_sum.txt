**Instruction:**

Enable hook methods to be returned like `describe` by modifying the implementation to ensure the return value of `beforeAll` and similar methods is the hook itself. Add necessary tests and documentation updates to support and demonstrate this functionality.

**Issue Fixed:**

The existing implementation does not support returning the hook itself when calling methods like `beforeAll`. This was not previously supported because unlike `describe`, which does return its suite, the hooks did not return themselves as expected. The PR addresses this discrepancy and fully fixes issue #5202.
