        "body": "### Description of the Change\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nWe must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. Keep in mind that the maintainers and/or community members reviewing this PR may not be familiar with the subsystem. Please be verbose.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExpose test file path for each test case in the `xunit` reporter.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<testsuite name=\"Mocha Tests\" tests=\"2\" failures=\"0\" errors=\"0\" skipped=\"0\" timestamp=\"Tue, 17 May 2022 21:10:34 GMT\" time=\"0.001\">\r\n<testcase classname=\"Array #indexOf()\" name=\"should return -1 when the value is not present\" file=\"/path/to/test/array.js\" time=\"0\"/>\r\n<testcase classname=\"Set #has()\" name=\"should return false when the value is not present\" file=\"/path/to/test/set.js\" time=\"0\"/>\r\n</testsuite>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->\r\n\r\n### Why should this be in core?\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain why this functionality should be in mocha as opposed to its own package -->\r\n\r\nThe test file path was already added to other reporters in this PR:\r\n* https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/4219\r\n\r\nIt seems the file path can be added to each reporter as needed.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\n* Can be easier to find test file from file path instead of just test name, especially when overlapping/similar/identical test names are present, or in a large codebase\r\n* In particular, it can be easier for automated tooling to find the test file from the file path as opposed to the test name when performing test analysis or other scripting\r\n\r\n<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->\r\n\r\n* Greater size / noise of output for people who don't need the file path\r\n* Let me know if there's any other reason not to do this\r\n\r\n### Applicable issues\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n<!--\r\n* Enter any applicable Issues here.\r\n\r\n* Mocha follows semantic versioning: http://semver.org\r\n\r\n* Is this a breaking change (major release)?\r\n* Is it an enhancement (minor release)?\r\n* Is it a bug fix, or does it not impact production code (patch release)?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis should be part of a minor release as an enhancement.\r\n\r\nI submitted this last year as #4885 but heard no response. I am recreating the same PR now after hearing interest in it in this comment: https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/4885#issuecomment-1547581224\r\n\r\nFixes #5112."
