The pull request aims to fix issue #5106 by updating the error reporting in the browser to include a more informative stack trace. This is accomplished by utilizing the `err` parameter in the `onerror` event. Follow these steps:

1. Implement the change by using the `err` parameter available in the `onerror` event to log a more detailed stack trace for uncaught errors in the browser.
2. Reference and ensure compatibility with related error capturing APIs, such as [`Window.error_event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/error_event) and the Node.js `process` API for uncaught exceptions.
