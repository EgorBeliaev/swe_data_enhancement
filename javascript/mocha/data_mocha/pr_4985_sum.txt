**Change Summary:**  
Add file path attribute to the `xunit` reporter for each test case.

**Instructions:**

1. **Modify `xunit` Reporter Output:**
   - Ensure the test cases in the `xunit` reporter output include a `file` attribute that specifies the test file path.
   - Example format:
     ```xml
     <testcase classname="Array #indexOf()" name="should return -1 when the value is not present" file="/path/to/test/array.js" time="0"/>
     ```
     
2. **Implementation Notes:**
   - This feature is already present in other reporters as referenced in PR #4219.
   - Ensure consistent handling across different reporters.

3. **Considerations:**
   - Larger outputs due to additional file path information.
   - Review any potential impact on existing integrations and automated tooling.
   - Check for any additional support, especially any related to Cypress, since further discussion might be needed.

4. **Release Information:**
   - This change should be included in a minor release since it is an enhancement (referenced as part of PR #5112 and included in v10.4.0).

**Issues Related to This Change:**
- An external issue reported by a user (`SophieDel`) indicated a problem with the "file" field using the xunit plugin in Jenkins. Further investigation and potentially a new issue might be needed.
