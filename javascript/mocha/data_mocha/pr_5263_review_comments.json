Hopefully the thrown error message is clearer to understand (I'm open to suggestions to further improve it).\r\n\r\nThis custom error is thrown in following cases:\r\n\r\n- A numeric argument was passed to cli (such as `mocha 123`)\r\n- A numeric argument was passed as a value to a mocha option that does not accept numerical values (such as `mocha --delay 123`)\r\n\r\nThe error is not thrown in if a numerical value is passed to mocha flag which can handle numerical values (such as `mocha --retries 2`) or if numerical value is passed to node options.\r\n\r\n\r\n*PS* - Apologies for posting this PR before receiving a reply to [this comment](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/5028#issuecomment-2494261947) I posted in the issue."

Just requesting changes on including a bit more information in the thrown error.\r\n\r\nThe [Style] nit is definitely not blocking if you want to assertively say that it's _numerical_, not _numeric_ \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nThanks!"

On the other hand, the implementation is looking great and is touching on some edge cases Mocha doesn't yet handle well. So this is looking like a really great new feature addition! \ud83d\ude80 \r\n\r\n"
