Instructions for Changes:

1. **Error Handling Implementation**: Add validation for files passed with the `--file` option by:
   - Resolving each file to an absolute path.
   - Checking if the file exists.
   - Logging a warning and exiting if a file does not exist.

2. **Code Adjustments**:
   - Review the usage of `process.exit` and `throw` statements within the code to ensure they're not deep within the codebase, as this might be problematic.
   - Modify the `handleUnmatchedFiles` helper function to correctly accept and utilize the mocha instance as a parameter.

3. **Testing**:
   - Add additional tests to cover the new validation logic for the `--file` option.
   - Fix the failing test related to the `handleUnmatchedFiles` function to handle undefined properties properly.

4. **Documentation Update**:
   - Update the documentation to accurately describe the current functionality of the `--file` option, clarifying that it does not support directories and globs.

5. **Miscellaneous**:
   - Acknowledge unrelated Netlify deploy-preview failures and ensure that these do not affect the current PR. 

This PR addresses the issue of proper error handling for nonexistent files specified with the `--file` option, contributing a fix that ensures stability during command execution.
