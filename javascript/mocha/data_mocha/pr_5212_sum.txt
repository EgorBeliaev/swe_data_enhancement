This PR addresses circular dependency issues in object values when using `--parallel` by implementing the following changes:

1. Addresses existing open issues: fixes #5188 and #5209.
2. Introduces a `seenPairs` `Set` to ensure properties are serialized only once, resolving infinite addition to `pairs`, and fixes issue #5209.
3. Ensures writes are only made to properties with `.writable` object descriptors, addressing issue #5188.
4. Note: Test failures on Node 22 are also observed locally on the `main` branch and are documented in issue #5213, not directly related to this PR changes.

These enhancements require attention to detail in managing circular references and property descriptors in serialized event processing.
