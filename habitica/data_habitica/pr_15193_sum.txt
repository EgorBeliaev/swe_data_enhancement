**Instruction:**  
Remove the `dependabot.yml` file from the `./github` directory.

**Issue Description:**  
The `dependabot.yml` file is being removed because the current maintainers lack the bandwidth to act on its recommendations, and it is not the right tool for managing package audits and updates at this time.
