Optimize database access with the following changes:

1. Adjust middleware loading order to eliminate extra database requests for user language retrieval.
2. Avoid updating the user object when requesting a non-existent guild.
3. Reduce the number of fields loaded for party members during skill usage.
4. Implement bulk updates for party members during skill usage.

These changes aim to significantly decrease the server's database query count.
