**Instructions for Changes:**

1. Update the class avatar display logic to show each class's best "basic" gear instead of Gala gear.
2. Adjust the positioning of class avatars to ensure they are centered and remain static when selected.
3. Modify the CSS to use `px` instead of `em` for margins and padding where appropriate.
