**Instructions:**

1. **Issue Fix**: This PR addresses Issue #13542, where the help text in the task column is obscured by a lengthy list of rewards.

2. **Modification**: Adjust the overlay-checking logic in the task columns to calculate the total height of the task list correctly. The logic should now account for the rewards list, including when there are no task cards present.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Ensure the height check for the task list is factoring in both task and reward cards.
   - Update the logic so that the help text remains visible unless the combined height of tasks and rewards obscures it.

4. **Test Scenarios**:
   - Verify that the help text is hidden when enough reward cards are present.
   - Confirm the help text appears when the number of reward cards is reduced.
   - Check that the help text is hidden with a mix of task and reward cards.
   - Ensure the help text shows when the mix of task and reward cards is reduced.
