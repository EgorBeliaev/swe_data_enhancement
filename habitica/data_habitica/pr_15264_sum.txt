**Instructions for Modifications:**

1. **Bundle Size Reduction:**
   - Ensure the client JavaScript bundle size is reduced by over 1MB, primarily by reducing the `chunk-vendors` file by 500KB to make it less than 1MB.

2. **Linting:**
   - Address the lint errors identified during the code examination.

3. **Build Process:**
   - Resolve the fatal error during the build process related to the import statement. Specifically, amend the module import issue in `/tmp/build_e64483e8/node_modules/validator/es/lib/isUUID.js` to ensure imports are used correctly within the module system.
