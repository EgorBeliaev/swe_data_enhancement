Because the rewards list includes two different card types (tasks and rewards), the overlay-checking logic wasn't being properly applied unless there was at least one task card.\r\n\r\nTo fix, the length of the task list is now only checked when its total heigh is calculated, allowing for the rewards list to also be taken into account (with or without tasks).\r\n\r\nSee screenshots below that show the new (desired) behavior:\r\n\r\n#### Help text hidden by reward cards\r\n![image](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/assets/920019/df8407b6-55f3-41b7-b4a1-349cd829e6c8)\r\n\r\n#### Help text shown by fewer reward cards\r\n![image](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/assets/920019/25f7b992-5706-4219-a052-0d877182c9f0)\r\n\r\n#### Help text hidden by mixed task and reward cards\r\n![image](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/assets/920019/87e5879a-8cfc-4d13-85ea-0bfdea4fff72)\r\n\r\n#### Help text shown by fewer mixed task and reward cards\r\n![image](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/assets/920019/c2aeb3ee-7909-4eca-a065-b8f071fee26c)\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nUUID: 5ba84aae-6676-4ff2-9d2f-c9c0b3c85fd6\r\n\r\n"
