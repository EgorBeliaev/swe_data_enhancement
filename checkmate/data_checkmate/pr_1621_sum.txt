**Instructions for Changes in the Repository:**

1. **Update `jobQueue.js`**:
   - Add a new line in the `QUEUE_LOOKUP` object. Map the `port` key to the `"uptime"` queue.

2. **Enhance Error Handling in `getSchedulerId` Function**:
   - Implement a check to ensure the monitor type is recognized by `QUEUE_LOOKUP`.
   - If an unrecognized monitor type is encountered, throw an error.

3. **Edge Case Management for Port Monitoring**:
   - Consider adding a new queue entry, `port_unresponsive`, to handle scenarios where ports are non-responsive or closed.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Perform load testing to assess the impact on the 'uptime' queue's performance.
   - Write and execute unit tests covering potential edge cases related to port monitoring.
