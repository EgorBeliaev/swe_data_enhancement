This pull request addresses several issues related to color and component consistency in the "Maintenance" and "Create Maintenance" pages. Key changes to be implemented include:

1. **Component Standardization:**
   - Replace the existing table and pagination components with standard components across the relevant pages for consistency and maintainability.

2. **Color Fixes:**
   - Correct the color discrepancies in the autocomplete component.
   - Update the picker component colors to align with the design specifications.

3. **Documentation and Configuration:**
   - Add JSDoc for the newly added `teamId` field in `Check.js` for consistent documentation.
   - Move hardcoded domain and path values in `seedDb.js` to a configurable object for improved flexibility.
   
4. **Code Refactoring:**
   - Extract the inline styles in `TablePagination` and header definitions in `MaintenanceTable` to separate files for better maintainability.
   - Remove outdated "CAIO_REVIEW" comments in the `Search` component and ensure reusable styling for tags.

5. **Backend Enhancements:**
   - Shift check retrieval methods to MongoDB's aggregation framework for performance improvements.
   - Ensure new field `teamId` is correctly propagated through network and DB operations for team isolation and data segregation.

The pull request also highlights a suggestion for minimizing its size, suggesting breaking changes down into smaller PRs for easier processing and review.
