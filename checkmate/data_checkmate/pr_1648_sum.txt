This pull request focuses on refactoring the Uptime Details components for improved maintainability and consistency in the user interface. The key modifications include:

1. **Component Modularity:**
   - Break down the Uptime Details UI into smaller, modular components such as `MonitorHeader`, `StatusBoxes`, `ChartBoxes`, and `ResponseTable`.
   - Introduce reusable components like `Dot` for consistent styling and functionality.

2. **Code Simplification:**
   - Extract complex functionalities and network operations into custom hooks.
   - Implement consistent loading states and use of a reusable Table component.

3. **Code Enhancements:**
   - Review and adjust PropTypes definitions for increased robustness, ensuring type checking is specific and consistent.
   - Optimize performance using hooks like `useMemo` for preventing excessive re-renders.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Address potential data access issues by implementing optional chaining and other safety checks within components.

5. **Routing and Configuration Updates:**
   - Refactor routing to seamlessly integrate new components `Uptime` and `UptimeDetails`.
   - Update routes in the `Routes/index.jsx` to handle URL parameters consistently.

6. **Utility Functions:**
   - Consolidate duplicate functionality in utility functions to reduce code duplication.

Apply these improvements to the repository to achieve a cleaner, more efficient Uptime Details page.
