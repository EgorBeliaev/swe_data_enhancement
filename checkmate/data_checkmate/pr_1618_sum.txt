### Instruction for Changes:

1. **Reintroduce exclusion for local and private IP addresses in the validation regex**:
   - Modify `Client/src/Validation/validation.js` to include logic that excludes private and local network IP addresses during URL validation.
   - Specifically, ensure the regex prevents IPs like `10.x.x.x`, `127.x.x.x`, `169.254.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`, `172.(16-31).x.x`, `198.18.x.x`, `240.x.x.x`, and `255.x.x.x` from validation.

2. **Exclude IP addresses reserved for future use and link-local addresses**:
   - Update the regex pattern to exclude IP addresses like `198.18.x.x` and `169.254.x.x`, which are reserved or link-local.

3. **Implement and ensure robust testing**:
   - Add test cases for the validation logic to confirm the exclusion of local, private, reserved for future use, and link-local IP addresses.
   - Example test cases:
     ```javascript
     expect(validateUrl('http://192.168.1.1')).toBe(false);
     expect(validateUrl('http://10.0.0.1')).toBe(false);
     expect(validateUrl('http://198.18.0.1')).toBe(false);
     expect(validateUrl('http://169.254.0.1')).toBe(false);
     ```

4. **Update documentation**:
   - Ensure the regex documentation clearly explains which sections pertain to exclusions and describes its intended purpose. 

These steps will ensure that the monitor service continues to align with its functionality of tracking and monitoring public-facing servers, enhancing both performance and security.
