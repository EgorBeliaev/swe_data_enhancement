Update the URL validation logic in `Client/src/Validation/validation.js` to:

1. Modify the regular expression to allow URLs without a protocol, adding a default `'http://'` if none is provided. Ensure the regex checks for a valid protocol (e.g., `'http'`, `'https'`, `'ftp'`).

2. Remove any commented-out code related to `usage_system` and `usage_swap`.

3. Ensure consistent handling of URLs with and without protocols, particularly where backend services are involved to prevent inconsistent URL submissions and potential security vulnerabilities.

4. Implement error handling that throws an error for invalid URLs and handles edge cases to maintain system stability.

5. Conduct tests to validate URL submissions with and without protocols and ensure backend service compatibility with these submissions.

6. Ensure no other significant architectural changes are needed for system interactions.
