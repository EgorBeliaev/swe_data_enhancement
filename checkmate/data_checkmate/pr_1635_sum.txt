### Instructions for Repository Updates

1. **UI Component Modifications:**
   - **Border Radius Adjustment:**
     - Change `borderRadius` from `"50%"` to `"10000px"` in the following files:
       - `Client/src/Pages/Infrastructure/index.jsx`
       - `Client/src/Pages/PageSpeed/index.jsx`
       - `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Home/UptimeDataTable/index.jsx`
   - **PageSpeed Component Updates:**
     - Increase border thickness from 1 to 2.
     - Update border color and apply new styles such as padding, font size, and font weight.
     - Remove unnecessary styles and clean up TODO comments in the CSS class `current-monitors-counter`.

2. **Error Fixes and Simplifications:**
   - **`validateDOMNesting` Error:**
     - Ensure that `<button>` elements are not nested improperly within one another.
   - **Sidebar Sticky Error:**
     - Fix the sidebar sticky functionality on the Infrastructure Detail page.
   - **Color Logic Simplification:**
     - In `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Home/index.jsx`, simplify the logic for determining `percentageColor`:
       - `< 25%: theme.palette.error.main`
       - `< 50%: theme.palette.warning.main`
       - `â‰¥ 50%: theme.palette.success.main`

3. **Code Refactor and DRY Principle:**
   - **StatusBox Components:**
     - Refactor repetitions using mapped arrays for the `StatusBox` component in `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Home/index.jsx`.
   - **Focus Styles for Accessibility:**
     - Ensure focus-visible styles are consistently applied to all buttons for accessibility improvements.

4. **Infrastructure Page Consistency:**
   - Align color definitions and other style changes with those made in the `Uptime` page to resolve inconsistencies from missed updates.

5. **Review Comments and Suggestions:**
   - Address nitpick comments such as removing outdated TODOs and embracing DRY principles in related components.

Implement these updates to enhance UI consistency, fix errors, and optimize code structure within the repository.
