**Instructions for NetworkService Redundancy Fix:**

1. **Move Initialization to useEffect:**
   - In `Client/src/Utils/NetworkServiceProvider.jsx`, move the initialization of `NetworkService` inside a `useEffect` hook to ensure it does not run on every render.
   - Ensure cleanup logic is added for when the component unmounts.

2. **Avoid Variable Shadowing:**
   - Avoid shadowing the imported `networkService` with a local variable of the same name. Either remove the local variable or adjust it to use the newly created `NetworkService` directly with the `setNetworkService` method.

3. **Implement Singleton Pattern:**
   - In `NetworkService.js`, replace the direct initialization of `NetworkService` with a singleton pattern. Create a function `getNetworkService()` to check if an instance already exists and return it; otherwise, initialize it.
   
4. **Document Usage:**
   - Consider clarifying the singleton pattern usage by adding documentation comments within `NetworkService`, or use a more descriptive naming convention for the singleton function.

5. **Test for Single Initialization:**
   - Write unit tests to ensure `NetworkService` is initialized only once. If errors occur during initialization, these should be properly handled and tested.
