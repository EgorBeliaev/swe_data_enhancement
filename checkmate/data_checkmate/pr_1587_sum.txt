**Instruction for the Programmer:**

1. **Remove UI Elements:**
   - Eliminate non-functional SMS and multiple email notification checkboxes from `Client/src/Pages/Uptime/Configure/index.jsx`.
   - Remove the associated conditional rendering logic tied to these checkboxes.

2. **Error Handling Improvements:**
   - Enhance the `handleChange` function by adding validation to check for the presence and validity of event target properties. Log an error message if properties are invalid or missing.
   - Improve the `handleSubmit` function to verify the result of the `updateMonitor` function and handle errors properly.

3. **Code Commenting:**
   - Instead of deleting, comment out the disabled UI elements to preserve potential future usage, as per user request.

These actions together aim to streamline the incident notification settings by cleaning up the user interface and adding necessary error handling improvements while maintaining code stability and clarity.
