1. **Validate Request Origin**: Implement request origin validation in `resultsCallback` function to ensure requests from authorized UpRock origins only.

2. **Add Data Validation**: Include basic data validation in `resultsCallback` function for monitor ID, success, and response time in the callback payload.

3. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance error handling in `resultsCallback` by adding specific error logging and passing errors to middleware.

4. **Disconnect Ngrok on Shutdown**: Ensure ngrok tunnel is closed when the server shuts down in development to avoid orphaned tunnels.

5. **Implement Authentication Middleware**: Add middleware to `/callback` route to authenticate requests from UpRock only.

6. **Enhance DistributedUptimeCheck Schema**: Expand schema to include fields like external response time, raw response, status code, and error message from UpRock.

7. **Logger Improvements for Ngrok**: Improve logging for ngrok URL establishment and disconnection.

8. **Add Integration Tests**: Create integration tests that cover scenarios like unauthorized origins, invalid payloads, and valid callbacks.

9. **Update Documentation**: Document the new `DistributedUptimeCheck` model, and `distributed_http` monitor type, and provide guidelines for configuring ngrok.
