**Instructions for the Programmer:**

1. **Fix Upload Progress Bug:**
   - Correct the upload progress display in the breakpoint continuation component. Ensure that after a file upload is successful, re-clicking "Upload File" does not cause the percentage value to continuously increase. Implement a feature to display an "Upload Completed!" message once the file is uploaded successfully.

2. **Optimize Button Style:**
   - Enhance the style of the "Select File" button for better UI/UX.
