Fixes and suggestions in the repository:

1. **Fix Struct Tag Field Error:**
   - Address the issue where `text/template` standard package removes spaces after hyphens, affecting struct tags formatting. 

2. **Remove Trailing Spaces in Comments:**
   - Eliminate unnecessary trailing spaces in field comments for cleaner code documentation.

3. **Standardize File Template Comment:**
   - Ensure `@accept` template comments start with uppercase 'A' for consistency and adherence to norms.

4. **Template File Naming Convention:**
   - Consider renaming template files in the `server\resource\plugin` directory from `.template` to `.tpl` for uniformity, although this is suggested as a personal preference.

Implement these changes to harmonize the codebase and improve code readability and consistency.
