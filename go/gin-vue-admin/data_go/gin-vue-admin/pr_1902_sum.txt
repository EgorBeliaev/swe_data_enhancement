### Instruction to Programmer:

1. **SVG Integration in Plugin Directory**: Allow SVG files located in the plugin directory to be used as components similar to SVG files in the project directory. Ensure SVG files in the plugin directory automatically receive a prefix derived from the plugin (directory) name to avoid filename conflicts between different plugin directories.

2. **Development Mode List Feature**: In development mode, modify the browser DevTool console to display a list of all detectable SVG components for use.

3. **Code Implementation Example**: Update the desired page with SVG component usage. For instance, integrate SVG components like `<email-c-coin-fill class="w-7 h-7"/>` and `<email-c-dataserver />` within the pluginâ€™s Vue file (`index.vue` in the example).

4. **Internal Use Recommendation**: While updating, remember it is recommended to utilize SVGs internally within the plugin to maintain organized code and resource structure.

These changes address the issue of seamlessly integrating SVG files from different plugins while maintaining a good resource organization.
