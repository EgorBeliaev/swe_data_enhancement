Update the `basetypes.go` file to handle the `origin_setting` column properly by reading it as a `string` instead of `[]byte`. This change addresses a scan error encountered when the database does not support JSON and stores the value as text. The solution has been tested in PostgreSQL, but compatibility with MySQL was problematic. An attempted fix with type assertion was not successful, leading to the PR being withdrawn. Further investigation and testing across different database environments (specifically, MySQL) are needed to ensure compatibility and prevent similar errors.
