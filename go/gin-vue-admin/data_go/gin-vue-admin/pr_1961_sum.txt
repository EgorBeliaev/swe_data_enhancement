**Instruction for Repository Fix:**

1. **Issue Summary**: There is a bug in the automated code generation process when the table name starts with an uppercase letter. This causes an error because the package name (form.value.packageName) begins with an uppercase letter, resulting in generated code with a leading underscore, which subsequently leads to a compilation error.

2. **Expected Fix**: Adjust the code generation logic to handle cases where the package name starts with an uppercase letter. Ensure that the generated code does not have a leading underscore to avoid compilation errors.

3. **Contextual Check**:
   - Verify the modification in the automated code that handles table and package names.
   - Perform end-to-end testing to ensure that tables with uppercase starting names do not cause errors. 

Focus on these corrections to resolve the issue detailed in the PR.
