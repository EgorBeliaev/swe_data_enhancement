### Instruction for Programmer

1. **Simplify PCI Device Classes:**
   - Modify the PCI device class configurations by eliminating redundant entries. The entry "02" should cover all entries starting with "02", since "02" implies "02*".

2. **Enhance Display Controller Detection:**
   - Adjust the detection logic for display controllers to include all "03" types, not just limited to "0302". This ensures broader compatibility.

3. **Compatibility with Upstream Default:**
   - Ensure that the default settings align with upstream NFD behavior by retaining inclusion of "03" as the default, consistent with the upstream NFD. This harmonizes the NFD behavior for users whether they are using NFD in NVIDIA's device plugin or the upstream version.

4. **DCO Compliance:**
   - Ensure all commits are properly signed off in accordance with the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) requirements before merging.

The changes aim to streamline the code, remove redundancies in PCI class identification, and align default behaviors with upstream standards for enhanced compatibility.
