**Instructions:**
1. **Rename Implementation:**
   - Rename the `DiagnosticCollector` for better clarity as suggested by peers.

2. **Code Cleanup and Enhancement:**
   - Refactor the implementation to utilize more reusable functionality, ensuring code cleanliness.
   - Pull the new implementation into a separate package under `common` for better organization.

3. **Logging Improvements:**
   - Ensure top-level logging of errors with sufficient context to aid in debugging.
   - Focus on adding granular control over object-specific logging for each test.

4. **Interface Considerations:**
   - Consider extensions to the `Collector` interface while contemplating additions to `kubectl-nv` and ensure compatibility with forthcoming changes in related pull requests.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Review and clean up error logging mechanisms to provide better debugging information.
   - Address these changes prior to porting the code to `kubectl-nv`.

6. **CRD Extension:**
   - Define initial support for CRDs, starting with `NodeFeature` and `NodeFeatureRule`.

**Note:** Pay special attention to not introducing breaking changes with current functionality in `kubectl-nv`.
