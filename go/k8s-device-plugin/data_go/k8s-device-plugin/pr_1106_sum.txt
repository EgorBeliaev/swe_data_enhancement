**Instruction for Programmer:**

- Modify the GPU mode labeler to raise a warning instead of an error if it fails, specifically addressing environments like WSL2 where GPUs do not appear as PCI devices.
- Ensure that GFD proceeds without setting the `gpu.mode` label when PCI devices are not detected but NVML is available.
- No backporting needed as long as the change is included in the next device-plugin release (0.18.0) and the upcoming GPU Operator release.

**Issue Being Fixed:**

This PR addresses a failure in GPU mode labeling in environments such as WSL2 where GPUs are not recognized as PCI devices. The change ensures that GPU Feature Discovery (GFD) continues to function normally without the `gpu.mode` label where PCI device information is absent, using NVML if available.
