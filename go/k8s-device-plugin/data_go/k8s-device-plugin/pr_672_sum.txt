**Instruction:**

Modify the vGPU label construction process to treat errors as warnings. Specifically, ensure that when errors related to vGPU devices are encountered (such as the inability to read PCI devices), the code should set the `nvidia.com/vgpu.present` label to `false` instead of raising an error, allowing the process to continue without fatal interruption.
