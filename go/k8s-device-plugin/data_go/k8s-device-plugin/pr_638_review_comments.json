Refer to: https://admin.pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PD/03\r\n\r\nAlso note that the default value of upstream NFD includes \"03\", as in this merge request. So this will improve compatibility and bring the behaviour in line with the standard defaults of upstream NFD. This way users can have the same standard expected behaviour whether they use NFD which is bundled in the NVIDIA device plugin, or upstream NFD."
