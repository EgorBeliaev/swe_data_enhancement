**Instruction to Programmer:**

1. **Enhancement:** Add support for populating node labels from sysfs when GPUs are configured for passthrough.
2. **Mode Flag Implementation:** Introduce a `mode` flag in a separate PR, supporting `nvml` and `tegra` modes initially, and update this PR to add the `vfio` mode.
3. **Configuration Structs Order:** Ensure configuration structs are ordered correctly, as pointed out in the review.
4. **Commits Management:** Squash the existing multiple commits into a single commit, particularly those with duplicate titles.
5. **PR Description Update:** Edit the PR description to include context instead of just a JIRA link.

**Issue Being Fixed:**

The current issue is that the GPU Feature Discovery (GFD) tool does not populate GPU-related node labels in passthrough mode because it relies on NVML to read GPU details. The PR aims to enable reading GPU details from sysfs, allowing correct node labeling for GPUs in passthrough mode.
