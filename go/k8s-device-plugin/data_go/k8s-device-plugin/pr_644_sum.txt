**Instruction for Implementation:**

Utilize the `quote` function in Helm to wrap boolean values with quotes in the templates. This is a safer approach as it prevents the YAML parser from interpreting unquoted strings like "true" and "false" as booleans. This best practice enhances readability by explicitly wrapping strings in quotes. The `quote` function behaves like `fmt.Sprintf("%q", str)` ensuring that any double quotes within strings are appropriately escaped. This change helps to avoid any unintentional alterations during the YAML parsing process.
