**Instruction:**

Fix the `allPossibleMigStrategiesAreNone` function in the helm chart helper to handle the default `configMapName` value, which by default is an empty string `""`. This incorrect default leads to unexpected behavior by breaking the function. Refer to NVIDIA's GitHub issue [#670](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/issues/670) for details.

_Note: Ensure that when a `configMapName` is set, it does not bypass the evaluation of `config.map` profiles, preventing the function from prematurely setting `$result = false`._
