Title: "Add support for node labels to report GPU mode."

## Instructions for Changes:
1. **Update Commit Message**: Clarify that the PR is about *reporting* the GPU mode, not *specifying* it.
2. **GPU Mode Label Handling**:
   - For all GPUs on a node, if modes are mixed or unknown, use the label value `nvidia.com/gpu.mode: unknown`.
   - For MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) devices, always report `compute` as the mode.
3. **Typos and Code Review**:
   - Address any typos in function names identified during the review.
   - Ensure consistency in behavior reporting specifically for MIG devices as per the PR intention.
4. **Intended Use**:
   - The label `nvidia.com/gpu.mode` enables applications to select worker nodes based on the GPU mode available.

Ensure these modifications reflect accurately in the code, commit messages, and documentation as necessary.
