The pull request addresses a bug in the `writeFileAtomically` function from the `gpu-feature-discovery` feature. The bug is due to incorrect file permissions when the function orders `os.Rename` followed by `os.Chmod`, which leads to temporary incorrect permissions (`0600` instead of `0644`) on the target file. The fix involves reordering the function calls to `os.Chmod` before `os.Rename`. Additionally, the PR proposes replacing `writeFileAtomically` with the `renameio.WriteFile` function for a more stable implementation of atomic file writing. This change also alters the creation location of the temporary file from `/etc/kubernetes/node-feature-discovery/features.d/gfd-tmp/` to `$TMPDIR`.
