**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Objective**: Modify the code to strip parentheses from the GPU product name to ensure label compliance.
   
2. **Testing**: Implement unit tests to validate the stripping logic.
   
3. **Optimization**: Consider implementing the suggested optimizations mentioned by reviewer `elezar`.

**Contextual Issue Being Addressed**:

- The initial problem is that the Node Feature Discovery (NFD) tool within the Kubernetes GPU Feature Discovery (GFD) setup generates labels for GPU products like "NVIDIA-TITAN-X-(Pascal)" which contain invalid characters `(` and `)`. These labels are rejected as they do not comply with the required label format (alphanumeric, '-', '_', or '.' characters). By stripping these characters, the labels will be valid and compliant with the expected format.
