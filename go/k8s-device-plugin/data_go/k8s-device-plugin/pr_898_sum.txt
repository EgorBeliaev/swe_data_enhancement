**Instructions for the Programmer**

1. **Modify Log Levels**: Adjust the log levels of certain error messages to improve logging clarity. This is part of the stated purpose of the PR.

2. **Fix Method Comment**: Review and correct the method comments for accuracy and completeness as mentioned in the PR description.

3. **Address CI Errors**: Resolve the integer overflow conversion errors identified by `gosec` tool in the following files:
   - `internal/resource/cuda-lib.go`: Lines 60 and 61 where conversion from `int` to `uint` occurs.
   - `internal/resource/nvml-lib.go`: Line 44 where conversion from `int` to `uint` occurs.
   - `internal/resource/nvml-mig-device.go`: Handling the conversion from `int` to `uint64` needs to be reviewed and corrected.

These adjustments are necessary to ensure that the PR can pass CI checks without errors.
