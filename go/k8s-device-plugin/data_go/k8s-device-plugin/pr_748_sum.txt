The PR addresses an issue in the "nvidia-device-plugin" Helm chart. The `hasConfigMap` option was inconsistently handled due to `helm include` statements returning strings rather than actual boolean values. The proposed changes introduce an options helper allowing derived values to be passed as JSON, preserving type information. This ensures consistent handling of the `hasConfigMap` across the repository. The PR aims to fix issue #689 by making these adjustments.
