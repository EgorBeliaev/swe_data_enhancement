### Instructions

1. **Remove Light Mode:**
   - Eliminate the light mode functionality in the block fetcher as BSC no longer supports light clients.

2. **Upstream Compatibility:**
   - Ensure that removal aligns with upstream where `BlockFetcher` has already been deprecated in the go-ethereum client.

### Rationale

- The changes are necessary due to the discontinuation of support for light clients by BSC, thus invalidating the need for light mode in the block fetcher.
