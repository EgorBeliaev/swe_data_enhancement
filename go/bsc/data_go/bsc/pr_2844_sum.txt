### Instructions for Programmer:

1. Implement support for the `GetFinalizedBlock` API to operate based on a fixed ratio of validators. This should accommodate scenarios where the number of validators varies across different networks.
2. Ensure that the implementation aligns with the user requirements for networks like opBNB, where a fixed validator ratio is necessary.
3. Update the code to allow flexibility in determining finalized blocks across different validator settings without hardcoding any specific number.
4. Add relevant examples, either through CLI or API responses, to demonstrate the use and output of the `GetFinalizedBlock` feature with common ratio validators.
5. Document notable changes and additions that support the described functionality in the codebase.
