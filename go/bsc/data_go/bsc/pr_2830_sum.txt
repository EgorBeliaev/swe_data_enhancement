**Instruction:**

Fix issues related to the fast node by addressing the following:
- Ensure proper saving and rewind of the pbss (presumably a component or module) during node operations to prevent in-memory trie node journaling failure when stopping the node.
- Repair the 'Head state missing, repairing' issue when restarting the node.

**Issue Being Addressed:**

The PR is targeting issue [#2829](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/issues/2829) which involves:
- The fast node encountering failures related to journaling in-memory trie nodes upon stopping.
- The node reporting 'Head state missing, repairing' upon restarting.
