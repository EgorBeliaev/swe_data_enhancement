**Instruction to Programmer:**

- Fix the `Label` type definition in the metrics code to restore compatibility with other similar metrics.
- Ensure that no information is lost due to the current `Label` type issues resulting from a recent sync.
- Check if the restored `Label` type maintains compatibility and information integrity across different parts of the code.
- Add examples of the fix in CLI or API responses to demonstrate the changes.
- Make sure to explicitly note each significant change in the code as separate bullet points as specified in the workflow.

**Issue Description:**

The `Label` type in the metrics module was defined in a non-standard way and became incompatible after a recent code synchronization. This mismatch results in the information typically carried by the `Label` type being lost. The PR aims to correct this incompatibility by aligning the `Label` type definition with other similar metrics. The changes ensure that the functionality and data integrity are maintained throughout the system.
