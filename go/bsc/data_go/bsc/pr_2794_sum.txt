Title: CI: Enhance 'Build Test' with Additional Checks

Instructions:
1. Update the 'Build Test' CI process to include the following checks:
   - `check_tidy`
   - `check_generate`
   - `check_baddeps`

2. Configure the CI system so that if any of these checks fail, the entire `Build Test` will fail.

3. These changes aim to:
   - Catch instances where `gen_config.go` is not updated after changes to `eth/ethconfig/config.go`.
   - Ensure `go mod tidy` is executed after modifications to `go.mod`.
