**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Core Component:** Modify `txpool` to accept `SetCodeTxType` transactions specifically for testing purposes.
   
2. **Testing Context:** Align the changes with the [prague-devnet-4](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/compare/master...lightclient:go-ethereum:prague-devnet-4#diff-3b03ebf997a1699ce8e84a53a4b3981e403e74e2f90128eb188ad4226703970c) to integrate these transactions into the legacy pool for simplicity, enhancing test scenarios.

**Rationale:** 
- Support for `SetCodeTxType` transactions in the pool is incomplete as noted in the referenced [pull request](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30949). This PR aims to temporarily bypass this limitation for testing.
