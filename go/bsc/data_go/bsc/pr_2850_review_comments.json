Previously the upstream code https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29191 has removed `--metrics.expensive`, and used `NewRegisteredResettingTimer` for all time metrics. It's not suitable for BSC now, a PR https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/pull/2814 reverts some metrics before, but it will cause misunderstandings about execution/validation/commit metrics(it will minus db read/commit time when enabling expensive metrics).\r\n\r\nSo this PR reverts default expensive metrics and makes the blockchain time metrics work as before.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nNotable changes: \r\n* metric: revert default expensive metrics in blockchain;\r\n* ...\r\n"
