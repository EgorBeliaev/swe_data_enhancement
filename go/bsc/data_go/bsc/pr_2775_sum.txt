**Issue:**  
The `TestTransferTransactions` test is not deterministic because the `TransferTransactions()` function runs asynchronously in the background without enough time to complete the transfer before the test checks the pending list. 

**Instruction:**  
- Introduce a small delay or wait mechanism after calling `TransferTransactions()` in the `TestTransferTransactions` test to ensure the background process has enough time to complete. This will make the test deterministic by allowing the transaction to end up in the pending list reliably.
