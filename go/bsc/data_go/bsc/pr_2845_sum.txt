### Instruction for Programmer:

Implement a feature to prevent the validator from being slashed when the node restarts by ensuring the completion of multiple block proposals before shutdown. Specifically:
1. Introduce a waiting mechanism on node restart that waits for ongoing block proposals to finish.
2. Set `MaxWaitProposalInSecs` to 30 seconds by default, aligning with the average restart duration on mainnet.
3. When using `systemd` for node maintenance, ensure `TimeoutStopSpec` is configured to be 60 seconds or more.
