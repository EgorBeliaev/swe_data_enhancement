**Instruction for Changes:**

- Fix `copyNodeCache` function in `triedb/pathdb` to correctly handle `asyncnodebuffer`.
- This fix is intended to resolve the issue related to a Node panic caused by concurrent map iteration and write, as mentioned in the referenced GitHub issue [#2810](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/issues/2810).
