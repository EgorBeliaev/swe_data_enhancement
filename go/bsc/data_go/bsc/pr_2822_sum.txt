### Instructions for Changes

1. Override the chain configuration settings before creating the Parlia engine to ensure the correct signer is used based on hardfork settings.
2. Modify the `LatestSigner` function within the codebase to dynamically select a signer based on the chain configuration (`config.ChainID`) and hardfork settings, replacing the existing logic as specified in the provided function snippet:
   - Use `NewPragueSigner` if `config.PragueTime` is set.
   - Use `NewCancunSigner` if `config.CancunTime` is set.
   - Use `NewLondonSigner` if `config.LondonBlock` is set.
   - Use `NewEIP2930Signer` if `config.BerlinBlock` is set.
   - Use `NewEIP155Signer` if `config.EIP155Block` is set.
   - Default to `HomesteadSigner{}` if none of the above conditions are met or if `config.ChainID` is nil.

Ensure that these changes reflect accurately in the creation of the Parlia engine for testing scenarios, allowing correct hardfork signer functionality.
