### Condensed Change Instructions

**Title:** Support loading legacy async buffer format in PBSS

1. **Primary Change:**
   - Implement support to load and correctly read legacy async buffer formats within journal files.
   - Ensure compatibility with journal version 0/1 for async buffers.

2. **Key Points:**
   - Address the issue related to unexpected journal versions (`unexpected journal version want 2 got 0`), allowing nodes to proceed with outdated or legacy formats.
   - The update targets legacy async buffer handling from older journal versions (specifically version 0 and 1).

3. **Issue Reference:**
   - Resolve the problem detailed in [GitHub Issue #2796](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/issues/2796).

4. **Additional Notes:**
   - The async buffer handling changed significantly with journal version 2, requiring backward compatibility with earlier versions.

These changes will enable smoother operation by facilitating legacy journal format support, crucial for environments with outdated logs that need processing without failure.
