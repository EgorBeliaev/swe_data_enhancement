**Instruction for Programmer:**

Revert the recent changes to default expensive metrics in the blockchain. Specifically, restore the previous behavior to ensure compatibility with current blockchain time metrics. This involves undoing the upstream removal of `--metrics.expensive` and the universal application of `NewRegisteredResettingTimer` for all time metrics. The goal is to avoid confusion regarding execution/validation/commit metrics, which currently misinterpret by subtracting database read/commit time when expensive metrics are enabled. Ensure that blockchain time metrics function as they did prior to the latest changes.
