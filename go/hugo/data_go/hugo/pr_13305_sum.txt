Issue Description:
The cascade property in Hugo is incorrectly affecting subsequent pages with similar names when it should only apply to the children of a specific page. Specifically, if a cascade is set on a page (e.g., `/team`), it incorrectly propagates to the next page named similarly (e.g., `/teams`), causing unintended rendering effects. This problem was introduced in Hugo version 0.123.0.

Affected Structure:
- `/team` (List of employees) should have cascade properties that do not affect `/teams` (Articles about Microsoft Teams).

Tested Bug and Scenario:
- Renaming the `/teams` folder to `/xteams` allowed rendering, indicating the cascade incorrectly affecting pages with similar starting names.
- Similar effects were observed with pages like `/microsoft` impacting rendering of `/microsoft-365`.

Resolution:
Remove cascade properties from front matter and specify them in the site's configuration to target specific paths and prevent unwanted propagation.

Recommended Configuration Change:
1. Remove cascade properties from front matter.
2. Update the site configuration to use cascades targeting specific paths:
   ```text
   [[cascade]]
   [cascade.build]
   render = 'never'
   [cascade._target]
   path = '{/s,/s/**}'
   ```

This change will suppress the rendering of all pages in the specified section, including the section page itself, preventing the cascade from affecting similar-named pages unintentionally.
