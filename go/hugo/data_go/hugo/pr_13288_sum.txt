**Instruction for Changes:**

- **Modification**: Adjust the handling of HTML comments when `unsafe=false`. Do not issue warnings for potentially unsafe HTML comments in this case.
- **Reasoning**: HTML comments, while not rendered, are prevalent in Markdown and should be preserved for their utility.
- **Commits**: Ensure both variants of HTML comment handling are addressed, as noted in commit `22145b5999d1f1ded65e82ce863ea27fd522de67`.
- **Follow-up Actions**: Implement a plan to deprecate the comment shortcode by emitting warnings. After approximately one year, move to throw errors, while retaining a simplified shortcode for future use.
