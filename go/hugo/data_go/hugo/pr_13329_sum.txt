**Instruction for Changes:**

1. **Edit-Loop Issue:** Resolve the potential edit-loop in server/watch mode that causes unnecessary rebuilds.
   
2. **Cache Management Enhancement:** Improve cache management by draining the cache eviction stack before calculating the change set, enabling more efficient and precise rebuilds, particularly for larger sites or when operating under low memory conditions.

3. **Dynacache GC Adjustment:** Integrate the dynacache garbage collection (GC) step with the cache buster step to prevent unnecessary CSS rebuilds, ensuring that after editing TailwindCSS-related files, subsequent non-CSS related changes do not trigger redundant rebuild processes.

This PR addresses the inconsistency noted in issue #13316, specifically focusing on TailwindCSS rebuild behavior where non-related template or content edits were unexpectedly slow due to repeated CSS rebuilding logic.
