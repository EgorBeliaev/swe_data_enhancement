Title: Modify Render Hooks Fallback Mechanism

Instructions for Programmer:
- Change the behavior of render hooks to only fallback to the HTML template if the specific output format template is not available.
- Ensure that HTML is treated as the default output format when no specific hook for the current output format is present.
- Maintain existing behavior for rendering, unless both specific and fallback templates are absent.
- This change may result in a breaking modification, but it should minimally impact users.
- Test the implementation using Hugo version 0.140.2+extended to ensure consistency and correctness.

Issue Description Fixed by PR:
The issue was that adding a specific output format render hook like "render-blockquote.rss" without providing "render-blockquote.html" unintentionally replaced the default HTML blockquote rendering. This led to unexpected behavior across various output formats. The resolution involves ensuring that HTML is used as a fallback when a format-specific template is unavailable.
