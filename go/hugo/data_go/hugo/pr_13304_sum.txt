**Issue Summary:**

There is a problem with the non-HTML custom output format (specifically for a custom search output) when using Hugo's fast render mode. The issue arises when modifying a data source for the search output format, resulting in the JSON file not being updated unless `hugo server` is restarted. 

**Reproduction Steps:**

1. Define a custom search output format on the homepage with the parameter `noAlternative` and ensure it is not `permalinkable`.
2. Run the server with `hugo server --watch`.
3. Modify the data source related to the search output format.
4. Note that the JSON file should refresh automatically but does not.

**Commit Fix Approach:**

1. **Header Check**: Add a condition to check for the HTTP request header `Sec-Fetch-Mode = navigation` to determine if the server request should be tracked as a user navigation.
2. **URL Comparison**: Ensure accurate comparison against the real relative URL for non-permalinkable output formats.

**Workaround:**
Use `hugo server --disableFastRender` to temporarily bypass the issue if needed.
