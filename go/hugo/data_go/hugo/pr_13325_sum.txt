**Instruction to Programmer:**

1. **Objective**: Remove leading whitespaces produced by the `youtube` shortcode when it's nested in another shortcode in `{{% %}}` mode.
2. **Testing**: Run `go test ./...` locally and fix any test assertions.
3. **Commits**: Squash all commits and update the commit message to align with the repository's guidelines. Suggested commit message:
   ```
   tpl/tplimpl: Adjust whitespace handling in YouTube shortcode
   ```

**Issue Description**: 
The `youtube` shortcode outputs leading whitespace, causing incorrect rendering as a blockquote when nested within another shortcode.
