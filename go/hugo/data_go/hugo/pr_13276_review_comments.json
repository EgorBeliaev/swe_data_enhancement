        "body": "I agree with you. In the vast majority of cases, the images are tiny.\r\n\r\nBut I think it's a good idea to add this option for 2 reasons: \r\n\r\n1. To be consistent with the `figure.html` shortcode, which features the loading attribute. This way, users really have control over image loading, with the shortcode provided by default.\r\n2. Because I can think of lots of other relevant uses, notably for creating deliberately large QR codes, with lots of text. I've just made a `{{< qr level=\u201chigh\u201d scale=16 >}}`. And as I'll have several on the page, for poetry, it would be useful.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Personal note.** I find the `qr.html` shortcode very, very well designed.\r\n\r\nThe variable harvesting part is great for overloading the default configuration. I wanted to create variables in the configuration, but it's so clear that I did it in my local shortcode, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{{- $targetDir := or (.Get \u201ctargetDir\u201d) \u201cimages/qr\u201d }}\r\n{{- $class := or (.Get \u201cclass\u201d) \u201cqr\u201d }}\r\n{{- $loading := or (.Get \u201cloading\u201d) \u201clazy\u201d }}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your work, @jmooring & @bep.\r\n"
