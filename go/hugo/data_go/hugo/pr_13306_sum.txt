**Instruction for Programmer:**

Update the `markup/goldmark` module to trim trailing newlines from both normal blockquotes and blockquotes with callouts during render hook processing. This change is aimed at ensuring consistent HTML output by making both blockquote types mirror each other. The adjustment addresses the unintended difference in the handling of trailing newlines and aligns with the behavior for callout blockquotes as specified in the closed issue #13302.
