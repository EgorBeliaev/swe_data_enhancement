### PR Summary: 

**Title:**
- **Fix:** RSS output error with incorrect URL when `baseURL` contains a subdirectory and `render hooks` are enabled.

**Issue Description:**
- Problem: RSS baseURL includes repeated subdirectory (`subdir/subdir`) rather than intended structure (`subdir`).
- Context: Occurs due to existing methods of force replacements in RSS related to `canonifyURLs`.
- Reference: Issue #13332. 

**Technical Instructions:**
1. Review and address the brute force replacements occurring in `hugolib/site.go` file between lines 1429-1435.
2. Eliminate redundant subdirectory additions by ensuring RSS links/image render hooks utilize `Permalink`.
3. Validate solution by ensuring the test case in the PR confirms URLs like `https://example.org/subdir/s1/p1/` and `https://example.org/subdir/s1/p2/a.jpg` are returned correctly in `public/index.xml`.

The PR aims to fix URL canonicalization issues by implementing permalink usage in RSS processing, providing simpler and correct link/image outputs.
