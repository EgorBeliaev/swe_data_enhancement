This was done as performance optimization for large Hugo sites.\n\nThat made much sense, but now there's a slight chance that we miss out on a change when rebuilding.\n\nThis commit fixes this by applying the same logic to the evicted items as if they were still in the cache. This should preserve the performance gains in db28695ff505f84aee69c72dcc9e192f674c86a1 and close the hole for the possible false negatives.\n"
