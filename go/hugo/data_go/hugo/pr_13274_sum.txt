**Changes to be Made:**

1. **Update Cache Key Construction:**
   - Modify the cache key to include the content hash of the base image in a chain.
   - Ensure the content hash is always included in the cache key.
   - Ensure the image config hash is always included in the cache key.

**Issues Fixed:**

- Addresses issue where changes to the `bgColor` in `hugo.toml` were not reflected until the image cache was cleared.
- Fixes the cache key issue with `images.Mask` filter where the cache did not account for mask content changes.
