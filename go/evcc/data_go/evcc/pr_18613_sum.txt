### Instruction for Programmer

**Enhance the Phase UI for Single-Phase Visualization:**

1. **Active Phase Display:**
   - Update the UI to display only active phases when phase currents are available.

2. **Single-Phase Charging Visualization:**
   - Modify the visualization for single-phase charging so that it consistently results in a single bar, irrespective of whether the phase is L1, L2, or L3.

3. **Maintain Detailed View:**
   - Ensure that the actual distribution of currents/phases remains visible in the Configuration UI under the loadpoint entry for diagnostic purposes. 

These changes aim to enhance the clarity and usability of the Phase UI during single-phase scenarios while keeping detailed data accessible for troubleshooting.
