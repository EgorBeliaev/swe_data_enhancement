1. Update the parameter `PowerMngUseGridPowerEnable` to `true` for RCT to charge from the grid in "Extern" mode, overriding PV production limitations.

2. Ensure that the battery does not discharge below its current state of charge (SoC) when the MaxSoc is smaller than the current battery SoC by configuring the RCT `minsoc` to be at its maximum, typically `97%`.

3. Clarify the utilization of the `maxsoc` parameter:
   - Determine whether the `maxsoc` is intended to limit charging from the grid only up to `maxsoc` or to define a general maximum charge level (typical max ~95%-97%).

4. Implement a functionality to load from the grid only up to a specific SoC if not yet present.

5. Consider integrating inverter power performance into the template by referencing a fixed individual value (`6000 W / 8000 W / 10000 W`) to allow `power_mng.battery_power_extern` usage, following user inquiry.
