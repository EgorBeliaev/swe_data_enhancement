**Instructions for Code Changes:**

1. Remove the temporary override of `site.batterySoc` to eliminate the risk of concurrent access reading an incorrect value.

2. Review the following code section for potential issues or logical inconsistencies:
   ```go
   if totalCapacity == 0 {
       totalCapacity = float64(len(site.batteryMeters))
   }
   ```
   This code snippet equates the number of battery meters to battery capacity, which may not be appropriate. Consider reassessing this logic, especially in scenarios involving both capacity-reporting and non-capacity-reporting batteries. However, exercise caution as the current setup may serve to prevent division by zero, albeit with potential biases in capacities.

**Issue with the Repository:**

The current setup may inadvertently allow for concurrent access to an incorrect `site.batterySoc` value and uses a placeholder logic that equates battery meters to capacity as a fallback, posing logical inconsistencies in battery capacity calculations.
