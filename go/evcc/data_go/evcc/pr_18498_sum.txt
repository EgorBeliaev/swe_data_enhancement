**Instruction for Implementing PR Changes:**

1. **Feature Addition:**  
   - Implement a feature to add a direct linking capability to the Loadpoint UI with a new parameter: `?lp=[INDEX]`.
   - Ensure the main screen correctly processes the new `?lp=[INDEX]` parameter.

2. **Functionality Update:**  
   - Modify the mobile interface so that changing the selection updates the URL. This enables easy sharing and bookmarking of the current view.

3. **Indexing Standard:**  
   - Use a 1-based index for the Loadpoint, ensuring it aligns with the existing REST API specification.

**Supporting Elements:**
- A screenshot (`url2`) and an action video (`url.webm`) have been provided to demonstrate the changes visually. You may refer to these for implementation clarity.
