                    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nI've an enphase system, so I get both PV requests and grid request going to it.\nThe issue is that both the grid and the PV part requests the same file. Also, only the PV template requests the 5 times(according to what I read here: https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/blob/master/templates/definition/meter/enphase.yaml )\n\nSo with the solar request, it makes 6 requests. When I manually request the file, it takes ~2-3s to request it.\nCurrently when I run my EVCC instance, I do get a lot of timeout. It varies a lot but it goes up to 4/5 of the requests being timed out.\nI've other stuff requesting data(READ ONLY, nothing active) from my enphase envoy(home assistant and potentially the app).\n\n\nI see two issues:\n\n1.  There is no way to set a timeout with the integration\n2. It's a shame that the same exact file get requested 6 times. \n\nDo you see any chance to reduce the number of requests made, especially for the PV implementation?\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Use both the grid and the PV implementation of enphase\n2. Run it in the day with some other system running\n3. Check the timeouts\n...\n\n\n### Configuration details\n\n```yaml\nmeters:\n  - name: my_grid\n    type: template\n    template: enphase\n    usage: grid\n    host: 192.168.0.196 # IP address or hostname\n    token: AAAAA\n\n\n  - name: my_pv\n    type: template\n    template: enphase\n    usage: pv\n    host: 192.168.0.196 # IP address or hostname\n    token: AAAAA\n\ntariffs:\n  currency: CHF\n  grid:\n    type: fixed\n    price: 0.2917 # EUR/kWh (default)\n    zones:\n      - days: Mo-So\n        hours: 21-0\n        price: 0.1881 # EUR/kWh (weekdays 2-6 hours)\n      - days: Mo-So\n        hours: 0-7\n        price: 0.1881 # EUR/kWh (weekdays 2-6 hours)\nchargers:\n  - name: easee_home\n    type: template\n    template: easee\n    user: ABC\n    password: DEF\n    charger: IJK\n    timeout: 30s # optional\n    authorize: \nvehicles:\n  - name: vehicle_1\n    title: Audi Q6\n    type: custom\n    soc:\n      source: js\n      vm: shared\n      script: |\n        var lp = state.loadpoints[0];\n        if (lp.chargepower > 0) lp.vehicleSoc+=0.1; else lp.vehicleSoc-=0.1;\n        if (lp.vehicleSoc < 15) lp.vehicleSoc = 80;\n        if (lp.vehicleSoc > 80) lp.vehicleSoc = 15;\n        lp.vehicleSoc;\n    range:\n      source: js\n      vm: shared\n      script: |\n        var lp = state.loadpoints[0]\n        var range = (44 * lp.vehicleSoc) / 15;\n        range\n    capacity: 44\nsite:\n  title: Maison\n  meters:\n    grid: my_grid\n    pv: my_pv\n\nloadpoints:\n  - title: Couvert\n    charger: easee_home\n    mode: pv\n    vehicle: vehicle_1\n\nsponsortoken: my-token\ninterval: 60s\n```\n\n### Log details\n\n```text\n[site ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:24:53 ----\n[lp-1 ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:24:53 charge power: 0W\n[lp-1 ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:24:53 charge currents: [0 0 0]A\n[site ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:24:54 grid power: -340W\n[site ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:24:57 pv 1 power: 852W\n[site ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:25:08 grid currents: [-0.907 -1.02 0.712]A\n[site ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:25:08 site power: -340W\n[lp-1 ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:25:08 charge total import: 1.744kWh\n[lp-1 ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:25:08 charger status: A\n[lp-1 ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:25:08 plan: charge 2h1m28s between 2025-02-03 04:13:32 +0100 CET until 2025-02-03 06:15:00 +0100 CET (power: 14490W, avg cost: 0.188)\n[site ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:25:53 ----\n[lp-1 ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:25:53 charge power: 0W\n[lp-1 ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:25:53 charge currents: [0 0 0]A\n[site ] ERROR 2025/02/02 16:26:03 pv 1 power: Get \"https://192.168.0.196/production.json\": net/http: request canceled (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)\n[site ] ERROR 2025/02/02 16:26:03 grid power: Get \"https://192.168.0.196/production.json\": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)\n[site ] DEBUG 2025/02/02 16:26:53 ----\n```\n\n### What type of operating system or environment does evcc run on?\n\nDocker\n\n### External automation\n\n- [x] I have made sure that no external automation like HomeAssistant or Node-RED is active or accessing any of the mentioned devices when this issue occurs.\n\n### Nightly build\n\n- [x] I have verified that the issue is reproducible with the latest nightly build\n\n### Version\n\n0.133.0",

The standard enphase HA integration only updates in 60s intervals.\n\n> 3. I see you use only two values from enphase, from what I see from the enphase template, there are other(like currents), don't you need them?> \n\nFor EVCC it only needs these to calculate the production and consumption graphs. I display them in HA in my energy dashboard, but it's just information.\n\n> Anyway, since Your python script, home assistant and the enphase apps are able to get some live data without any issue, I guess there is some kind of issue with the way evcc request data. From what I see, the fact that it requests 6x the data on each refresh could be it, or other app might use another endpoint?\n\nThe live data is a different endpoint to the production.json endpoint that EVCC uses. The overrequest might be an issue, but I've been having the same issues with the stock HA enphase integration that hits those same API endpoints. \n\n"
