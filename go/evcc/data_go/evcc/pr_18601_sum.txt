**Instructions for Changes in Repository:**

1. **Feature Addition**: Implement a second-layer HTTP cache replacement by setting cache headers.

2. **Template Parameterization**: Consider making the actual cache duration a template parameter for future enhancement.

3. **Cache Header Injection**: Introduce a middleware in the HTTP response to inject cache headers. This should occur before the HTTP cache sees the response.

4. **Patch Incorporation**:
   - Utilize the proposed patch: [0001-feat-http-Add-force-cache-headers-option.patch](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18660035/0001-feat-http-Add-force-cache-headers-option.patch).
   - Ensure that the Cache-Control decorator wrapping is placed after wrapping `httpcache.Transport`.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Test the changes thoroughly and initiate a pull request.

6. **Issue Address**: The patch and proposed changes aim to reduce the number of redundant HTTP requests made, particularly in PV implementation, and help manage timeout issues due to high request frequency. Use caching headers to manage request loads more efficiently.
