**Issue Description:**

The PR addresses a deadlock issue that occurs when using multiple connectors in the codebase. Specifically, the function `cs.RegisterChargepoint` initially calls `cs.mu.Lock()` and does not release the lock until after executing:

```go
// serialise on chargepoint id
reg.setup.Lock()
```

With multiple connectors, the second connector waits at `reg.setup.Lock()`, while `cs.mu.Lock()` remains locked. If a charge point connects, it triggers `cs.NewChargePoint`, which also attempts to call `cs.mu.Lock()`, causing the system (`evcc`) to halt until a connection timeout occurs. This PR resolves the deadlock problem.
