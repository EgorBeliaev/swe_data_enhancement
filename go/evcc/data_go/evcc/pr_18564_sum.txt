**Instructions for Programmer:**

1. **Remove Features:**
   - Eliminate the `evcc token` command line integration.
   - Delete any unused code related to this feature.

2. **Documentation Update:**
   - Modify the template documentation to reflect the changes.

3. **API Version Requirements:**
   - Update the minimum API version numbers in the codebase to match the new requirements.

**Additional Context:**
- Note that the email/pin authentication method has been disabled, and the version requirements have been raised by MB.
- Auth/refresh tokens should now be created using client-side tooling referenced in the PR.
- Avoid altering `identity.py` as this was addressed in a previous PR (#18412) by `andig` and has been reverted. 

**Repository Issue:**
- There is an error indicating that an issue with the number 18412 could not be resolved in the repository. It might not exist or there could be a typo in the reference number.
