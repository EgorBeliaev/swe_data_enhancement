**Instructions to Programmer:**

1. **Reentrant Locks Issue**: Address the issue caused by the assumption that `RLocks` are reentrant, which is incorrect. Refer to the discovery made in [issue comment](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/issues/18603#issuecomment-2640900927).

2. **Locking Strategy**:
   - Utilize `RLocks` only in API functions, which should be exported and capitalized.
   - Avoid using additional `RLocks` within internal functions, which are lowercase.
   - Ensure the `Update` function uses API functions whenever possible.
   - Use lowercase naming for Loadpoint methods as an indicator that locking might be absent, but this is not a guarantee.
   - Capitalize methods to ensure locking is implemented.

3. **Refactoring**:
   - Instead of a major overhaul, address and fix the obvious issues identified.

4. **Dependency**:
   - Implement a fix for the configuredPhases, which is dependent on [PR 18638](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/pull/18638). Keep in contact with @naltatis regarding this dependency.

Notes: You should be cautious with locking patterns, and no existing tools can aid this specific error, so manual adjustments might be necessary.
