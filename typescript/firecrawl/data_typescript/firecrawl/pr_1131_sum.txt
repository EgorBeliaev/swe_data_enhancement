The GitHub pull request addresses the following issues and changes needed for self-hosting setup:

1. **Fix Corepack Issue**:
   - Resolve corepack issue by following the suggestion from the [pnpm GitHub issue](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9029#issuecomment-2631400936).

2. **Set Docker Ulimit**:
   - Avoid setting `ulimit` in the `docker-entrypoint.sh` as it isn't supported in some environments.
   - Instead, configure `ulimit` in the `docker run` command or in the Docker Compose file, using configuration similar to:
     ```
     docker run --ulimit nofile=65535:65535 your-image
     ```

3. **Dockerfile Signature Issue**:
   - Address a signature issue in the Dockerfile causing build errors on Intel MacBook Pro by making necessary tweaks.

4. **Node Version Update**:
   - Consider updating the Docker base image to `node:23-slim`, which includes updated signing keys. The current `node:20-slim` doesn't have them, resulting in the key-matching error during `pnpm install`.

5. **Handle Missing SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN Error**:
   - Adjust Docker configuration to manage potential `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` missing error during build process.

6. **Avoid Frozen Lockfile Errors**:
   - Ensure `pnpm-lock.yaml` file exists to prevent errors like `ERR_PNPM_NO_LOCKFILE`.

7. **Sentry Import Error**:
   - Comment out contents of `services/firecrawl/apps/api/src/services/sentry.ts` to bypass Sentry import error for now.

These changes address corepack issues, Docker environment configurations, and mitigate errors during builds on different systems.
