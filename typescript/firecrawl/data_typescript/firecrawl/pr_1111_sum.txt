**Instructions for Changes:**

- Implement storing of v0 users associated with a team ID in Redis. This is a prerequisite step for sending out emails.
- Ensure that only unique UUIDs are stored in Redis to avoid memory pressure, as Redis is utilized for ease of querying without creating a new table.
- Monitor Redis for any potential memory pressure issues during this change.
