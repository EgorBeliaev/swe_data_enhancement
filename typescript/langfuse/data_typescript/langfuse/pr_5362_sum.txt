**Instruction for Repository Update:**

1. **Initialize Redis Connection Lazily:**
   - Set `lazyConnect: true` in the `createNewRedisInstance` function within the `RateLimitService`. This defers the Redis connection until the first command is executed.

2. **Modify `checkRateLimit()`:**
   - Ensure that the Redis connection is established within `checkRateLimit()`, if not already connected.
   - Implement error handling to handle connection issues gracefully, allowing the service to remain operational even if Redis is unavailable (fail open strategy).

3. **Code Maintenance:**
   - Apply minor comment updates in the `RateLimitService.ts` file to improve code documentation.

These changes aim to resolve connection errors by enhancing the Redis client connection management in the `RateLimitService`.
