Title: **fix(ui-markdown): fallback to json view if markdown parsing is unsuccessful**

Instructions:

1. **Update `MarkdownRenderer`:**
   - Modify `MarkdownRenderer` in `MarkdownViewer.tsx` to include fallback functionality. If markdown parsing fails, the application should display the content in a JSON view.
   - Add an info message feature to be displayed when the application falls back to JSON view.

2. **Dependencies Update:**
   - Ensure `package.json` includes the following new dependencies to support markdown functionality:
     - `remark-parse`
     - `remark-rehype`
     - `remark-stringify`
     - `unified`

3. **UI Component Update:**
   - Integrate the `Info` icon from `lucide-react` to visually indicate markdown parsing failure.
