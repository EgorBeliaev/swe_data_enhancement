This Pull Request addresses a bug within the adapter-postgres and adapter-pglite packages by updating the SQL query in the `getCachedEmbeddings` function. The issue arises from the current query structure: `content->$2->>$3` incorrectly looking for `content->'content'->>'text'` within the `{"content": {"text":""}}` structure of the **content** field, whereas it should search within `{"text":""}` of the **content** field directly. This PR modifies the query to use only the 'text' subfield correctly. 

No changes to the documentation are needed, and automated tests are considered sufficient for validation.
