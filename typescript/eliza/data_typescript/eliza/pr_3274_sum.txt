### Instructions to Programmer:

1. **Issue Explanation**: The function `handleGoogle(options)` is currently failing to pass the `apiKey`, leading to an error where `generateObject` does not function properly with the `google` model.

2. **Error Details**: The specific error encountered is `LoadAPIKeyError [AI_LoadAPIKeyError]: Google Generative AI API key is missing`. This error suggests that the `apiKey` is either not being passed as expected or is missing entirely.

3. **Fix Needed**: Modify `handleGoogle(options)` to ensure that the `apiKey` can be successfully passed. This key needs to be provided either through the `apiKey` parameter or by setting it as the `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable.

4. **Contextual Information**: The problem arises when the `apiKey` is not correctly relayed from character settings, resulting in the error when the `generateObject` function is called.

5. **Change Classification**: This is a bug fix. No documentation changes are deemed necessary for this update.

6. **No Auto Review**: Note that automatic reviews are disabled for this repository, and utilize manual code review processes accordingly.

By implementing these changes, the error should be resolved, allowing the `generateObject` function to correctly access and use the `Google Generative AI API` key through `handleGoogle(options)`. Make sure to test the function thoroughly after making the changes to confirm that the issue is fixed.
