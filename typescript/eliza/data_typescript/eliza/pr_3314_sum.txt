The pull request introduces a feature that allows plugins to interact with `messangerManager` to post messages on Telegram. This implementation involves calling the Telegram bot to generate messages. It draws inspiration from the existing Twitter client, which offers similar functionality by allowing access to post tweets.

No specific code changes or line-by-line instructions are provided in the discussion. The PR mainly outlines the new interaction capability with Telegram through plugins.
