**Instruction for Programmer:**

Ensure the user-room connection in the Slack client before inserting a memory into the PostgreSQL database to prevent foreign key constraint errors. Implement `ensureConnection` in the runtime to automatically create a user in the users table, allowing memory insertion without errors. Consider applying similar constraints in the SQLite adapter for consistency across database adapters.
