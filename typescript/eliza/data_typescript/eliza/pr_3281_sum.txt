Fix the issue in `generation.ts` related to the OpenAI-like provider endpoint resolution. Ensure that both `generateText` and `generateObject` use the correct endpoint. Currently, `generateText` uses:

```ts
const endpoint =
    runtime.character.modelEndpointOverride || getEndpoint(provider);
```

Modify `generateObject` to also utilize this endpoint resolution approach instead of directly using OpenAI. This change is a non-breaking bug fix in the core plugin.
