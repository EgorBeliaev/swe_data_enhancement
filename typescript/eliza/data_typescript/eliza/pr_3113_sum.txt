Fix the `normalizeJsonString` function to address the error encountered when a JSON array is used as a value. Ensure it correctly identifies square brackets as the starting character of a value to prevent the introduction of erroneous double quotes, which was causing `SyntaxError` in JSON parsing. Add a failing test to replicate the issue and verify that the regular expression change resolves it as expected.
