**Feature Update: Outbound Image URL Storage**

1. **File Changes**: Focus your review on `utils.ts` and specifically on the `sendTweet` function. 
   - Implement logic to store image URLs in memory when sending tweets.
   - Ensure outbound tweets maintain image context, consistent with inbound processing.

2. **Testing**: Conduct the following tests:
   - Send a tweet with an image and verify that image URLs are correctly stored in memory.
   - Confirm that the memory structure for outbound tweets mirrors the inbound format.
   - Ensure image context is preserved throughout the conversation threads and that memory data is consistent.

3. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Review the possibility of enhancing message content, potentially by including fields like `(inReplyTo)`.
   - Consider whether simplifying thread navigation is feasible or validate the proposed method of handling message chains.
