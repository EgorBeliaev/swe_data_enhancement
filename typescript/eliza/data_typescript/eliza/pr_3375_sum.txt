### Instructions from JSON PR Discussion:

1. **Objective**: Enable loading character paths relative to the repository root.

2. **Implementation Detail**:
   - Modify the code to add the path `${cwd}../..` to the list of paths to try. This adjustment is intended to navigate up from `packages/agent` to the repository root.

3. **Usage Example**:
   - Users should be able to run the following command:
     ```shell
     bun run agent -- -- --character=./characters/trump.character.json
     ```

No extraneous review comments or feedback relevant to the implementation are present in the JSON. Ensure that changes do not break existing functionality and confirm alignment with the repository's coding standards and structure.
