**Instruction for Repository Update:**

Update the regex pattern in the quote conversion logic to properly handle whitespace. The current pattern only matches a string (such as 'something') when directly followed by a comma, closing brace, or closing bracket with no intervening whitespace. Modify the regex to allow the match to include zero or more whitespace characters before these delimiters, ensuring array parsing does not fail in cases where whitespace is present, such as:

```json
[
  'MANAGE_POSITIONS_RETRIGGER_EVALUATOR'
]
```

Ensure this update does not affect other parts of the functionality adversely.
