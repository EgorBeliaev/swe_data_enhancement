**Instruction for Programmer:**

The current PR aims to address an issue with the yargs argument parsing in the character loading process for the agent. When running an agent with a custom character, the command requires inclusion of multiple "--" to avoid args parsing issues. Specifically, the `--character` argument is being sliced incorrectly, which impacts the intended use. You need to adjust how yargs handles the argument slicing to ensure that the `--character` parameter is passed correctly to the application without getting cut off. The command needing fix is:

```
bun run agent -- -- --character=./characters/trump.character.json
```

Ensure the modified handling allows this command to correctly process the `--character` argument in the `ARGV` list without manipulation. Additionally, the observation regarding the agent running on `node` may point to another bug or environment artifact; however, this is marked as separate from the primary issue being addressed.
