### Instruction to Programmer:
Enhance the Slack client within the repository to correctly handle attachments. Specifically:

1. Implement the download and upload functionality for attachments.
2. Ensure actions such as "describe an image" now correctly process raw attachment IDs.
3. Verify that summarizing conversations with text attachments operates as intended.

This is a bug fix with low risk according to the PR description.
