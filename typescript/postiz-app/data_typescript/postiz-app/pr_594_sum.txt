**Instructions for Changes in InstagramProvider Analytics:**

1. **Update the `analytics` method in `instagram.provider.ts`:**
   - Remove `profile_views` from the first API call while retrieving insights.
   - Add a second API call to gather metrics for likes, comments, shares, saves, and replies.
   - Combine results from both API calls into a unified analytics data array, maintaining the existing method signature.

These changes improve the breadth of social engagement metrics available for Instagram analytics and provide a clearer view of performance trends. Make sure the insights are aggregated with date information.
