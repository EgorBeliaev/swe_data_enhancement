**Instructions for Programmer:**

1. **Authenticate Method**: Update the logic to handle both public and private Telegram groups/channels. Ensure fallback from `chat.username` to `chat.id` if `chat.username` is not available.

2. **getBotId Method**: Enhance the functionality to correctly identify the chat based on group or channel properties.

3. **Media Handling**: Refactor the `post` method to:
   - Allow sending local files with content type handling.
   - Improve media processing, including MIME type detection and automatic grouping for optimized delivery.

4. **Local Storage Support**: Introduce `frontendURL` and `mediaStorage` constants for local storage support.

5. **chunkMedia Method**: Implement a new method to split media arrays into groups of ten, complying with Telegram’s API limitations.

6. **Bot Administrative Functions**: Add a `botIsAdmin` method to check the bot’s admin status in a chat for better control flow.

7. **Environment Variables Validation**: Consider using a validation library to ensure environment variables are present and correctly formatted.

8. **Logging**: Remove all `console.log` debug statements from production code.

9. **Message Deletion**: Implement immediate deletion of the message once posted, but ensure it only works if the bot is an admin in the chat.

These changes aim to improve functionality, robustness, flexibility, and performance of the Telegram integration while addressing current operational challenges.
