The pull request introduces a registration control feature to improve user management within the application. Here are the key changes:

1. **Backend Enhancements:**
   - Add a `canRegister()` GET endpoint in `auth.controller.ts` to check registration availability.
   - Implement `canRegister()` in `auth.service.ts` to determine registration eligibility based on environment variables and the total number of organizations.

2. **Frontend Adjustments:**
   - Implement conditional rendering on `auth/page.tsx` to reflect registration status and accommodate system settings.

3. **Organization Count Retrieval:**
   - Include a `getCount()` method in `organization.repository.ts` and expose this via `organization.service.ts` to retrieve and utilize the total number of organizations as a part of the registration validation process.

Ensure these changes are thoroughly tested and integrated into the existing authentication and registration flow, maintaining alignment with system settings and user experience improvements.
