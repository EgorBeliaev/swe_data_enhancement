Enhance the DiscordProvider class's channel filtering by adding support for "Announcement" type channels (GUILD_ANNOUNCEMENT, type 5). Refactor code to use constants for channel types and add JSDoc comments for maintainability. This addresses issue #582, which requests the inclusion of "Announcement" text channels in selection options during post creation.
