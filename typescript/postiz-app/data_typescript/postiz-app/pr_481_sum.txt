**Instructions to Programmer:**

1. **Enhancement:** Update the `uploadPicture` method in `linkedin.provider.ts` to include a new `type` parameter that specifies the media type (personal or company).

2. **Image Processing:** Enhance the image processing logic using the `sharp` library. Ensure that JPEG conversion and resizing of images are handled effectively for LinkedIn posts.

3. **Media Upload Handling:** Modify the `post` method to manage multiple media uploads concurrently using `Promise.all`. Implement a filter to ensure only valid media IDs are sent to LinkedIn.

4. **Error Handling:** Introduce a `BadBody` exception for better error handling. This should provide clearer feedback on posting errors.

**Context:** This PR addresses issues with LinkedIn's media uploads not handling PNG files correctly by improving error handling and adding support for different media types and formats.
