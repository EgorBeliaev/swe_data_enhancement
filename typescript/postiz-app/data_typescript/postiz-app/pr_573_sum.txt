The PR proposes the following changes to the TikTok provider in the repository:

1. **Feature Addition**: Introduce a choice between `DIRECT_POST` and `UPLOAD` modes for TikTok content posting.
   - Implement this choice in the frontend by adding a `<Select>` component in `apps/frontend/src/components/launches/providers/tiktok/tiktok.provider.tsx`.
   - Use a constant `contentPostingMethod` to define the available options.

2. **Backend Handling**: 
   - Modify the `post` method in `libraries/nestjs-libraries/src/integrations/social/tiktok.provider.ts` to dynamically select the endpoint URL based on the chosen posting method (`/video/init/` for `DIRECT_POST` or `/inbox/video/init/` for `UPLOAD`).
   - Implement this logic using a ternary operator for simplicity and better readability.

3. **DTO Update**: 
   - Add a `content_posting_method` property to the `TikTokDto` class located in `libraries/nestjs-libraries/src/dtos/posts/providers-settings/tiktok.dto.ts`. This property should accept `'DIRECT_POST'` or `'UPLOAD'` as values.

4. **Review Feedback Fixes**: 
   - Ensure type safety and remove unnecessary switch cases as suggested in the mentioned nitpick comments.
   - Address ESLint warnings on unescaped single quotes in the descriptive text for `UPLOAD` option by using HTML entities.

These changes aim to provide flexibility in how TikTok content is managed, allowing for uploads that can be later edited directly within TikTok before posting live.
