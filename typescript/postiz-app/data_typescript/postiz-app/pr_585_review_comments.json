Specifically, the channel type filtering has been expanded to include an additional channel type. The modification allows for more channel types to be processed when retrieving channels, potentially increasing the range of channels that can be selected or interacted with in the application.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File | Change Summary |\n|------|----------------|\n| `libraries/nestjs-libraries/src/integrations/social/discord.provider.ts` | Updated channel type filtering to include types `0`, `5`, and `15` |\n\n## Possibly related issues\n\n- [gitroomhq/postiz-app#582](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app/issues/582): The changes directly address the issue of supporting additional Discord channel types, specifically by expanding the channel type filter to potentially include \"Announcement\" channels (type `5`).\n\n## Poem\n\n> \ud83d\udc30 Channels dancing, types unfurled\n> Discord's secrets now uncurled\n> From zero to five, fifteen too\n> Our filter's magic breaks through! \n> A rabbit's code, precise and bright \ud83c\udf1f\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end -->\n<!-- internal state start -->\n\n\n<!-- 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 -->\n\n<!-- internal state end -->\n<!-- finishing_touch_checkbox_start -->\n\n<details>\n<summary>\u2728 Finishing Touches</summary>\n\n- [ ] <!-- {\"checkboxId\": \"7962f53c-55bc-4827-bfbf-6a18da830691\"} --> \ud83d\udcdd Generate Docstrings (Beta)\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- finishing_touch_checkbox_end -->\n<!-- tips_start -->\n\n---\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Given the nature of the \"Announcement\" text channel type in Discord, it would be expected to be supported by Postiz.\n\n### \u270c\ufe0f How do you aim to achieve this?\n\nWhen selecting a channel for the created post in Postiz, text channels of the \"Announcement\" type should appear just like all other channels.\n\n### \ud83d\udd04\ufe0f Additional Information\n\nIt may be intended behaviour for the \"Announcement\" text channel type not to appear among the text channels, but I couldn't find any issues or documentation indicating that this is intentional.\n\nInitially, I thought it might have been a permissions issue within Discord. However, when I disabled the \"Announcement Channel\" setting on one of these announcement text channels, it appeared immediately in Postiz\u2014so it's not a permissions issue.\n\nI was surprised that \"Announcement\" text channels don't show. The text channel designated as the community's \"Rules or Guidelines Channel\" in the server's community overview settings does appear. Even \"Forum\" text channels show up, and they have a completely different way of interacting with them than regular text channels!\n\n### \ud83d\udc40 Have you spent some time to check if this feature request has been raised before?\n\n- [x] I checked and didn't find similar issue\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\nNone",
