This pull request introduces enhancements and new features to the integration and plug management system in the project. Here are the key changes you need to implement:

1. **Backend Integration Changes**:
   - Implement a new method `getInternalPlugs` in `apps/backend/src/api/routes/integrations.controller.ts` to retrieve internal plugs for integrations.
   - Add an `internalPlug` method in `apps/workers/src/app/plugs.controller.ts` for processing internal plugs.
   - Introduce methods for retrieving and processing internal plugs in `libraries/nestjs-libraries/src/integrations/*`.

2. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Introduce the `InternalChannels` component in `apps/frontend/src/components/launches/internal.channels.tsx` for managing internal plug configurations.
   - Update multiple frontend components in `apps/frontend/src/components/launches/*` to handle the `allIntegrations` property, enhancing integration manageability.
   - Update modal components to support a wider range of integration options.

3. **New Feature and Improvements**:
   - Introduce a `PostPlug` decorator in `libraries/helpers/src/decorators/post.plug.ts` for metadata management relating to internal plugs.
   - Enhance error handling and data fetching mechanisms for integration-related functionalities.
