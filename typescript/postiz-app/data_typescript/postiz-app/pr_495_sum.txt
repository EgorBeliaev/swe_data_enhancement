The pull request addresses an issue with excessive input lengths during user registration. In the `CreateOrgUserDto` class, add maximum length validation to improve input constraints:

1. **Password Field**:
   - Add `@MaxLength(64)` decorator to ensure passwords do not exceed 64 characters.

2. **Company Name Field**:
   - Add `@MaxLength(128)` decorator to limit company names to 128 characters.

These changes aim to enhance input validation and improve data integrity during organization user creation.
