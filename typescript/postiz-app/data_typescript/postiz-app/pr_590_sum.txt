**Instructions:**

1. **New Features:**
   - Implement an aggregated email digest feature to collect and deliver recent notifications.
   - Enhance notification handling to guarantee timely email updates to organizations.

2. **Refactor Details:**
   - **PostsController & PostsService:** 
     - Introduce `sendDigestEmail` methods. Make PostsController listen to a Redis event and use PostsService to construct and send a digest email based on recent notifications.
   - **NotificationService & NotificationsRepository:**
     - Add `getNotificationsSince` method to retrieve notifications since a specified date.
     - Update NotificationServiceâ€™s `inAppNotification` to include a digest parameter and create a `sendEmailsToOrg` method for delivering emails to organization members. Integrate BullMQ for event emission.
   - **Bluesky Provider:**
     - Remove the unused `NotEnoughScopes` import.

3. **Deployment Integration:**
   - Ensure Vercel deployments are correctly integrated with the new features. Review skipped deployments for potential issues.

4. **Sequence Logic:**
   - Implement and test the sequence logic described in the provided mermaid sequence diagram to ensure correct data flow and event handling.

5. **General Cleanup:**
   - Remove redundant code and streamline integration with social and notification services, as noted in the chores section.

Ensure all changes are tested and documented for future reference.
