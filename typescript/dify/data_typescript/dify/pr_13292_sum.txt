**Instruction:**

Implement rate limiting on the password reset functionality to prevent brute force attacks. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure the rate limiting logic is applied correctly to the password reset endpoint.
2. Update the associated documentation as linked in the PR to reflect the changes made.
3. Verify the implementation by adding and running appropriate tests to confirm the rate limiting functionality.
4. Use formatting tools (`dev/reformat` for backend and `cd web && npx lint-staged` for frontend) to ensure code consistency and style adherence.

**Issue Description:**

The repository previously lacked adequate protection against brute force attempts on the password reset mechanism, potentially exposing users to security vulnerabilities. This PR addresses the problem by introducing rate limiting to safeguard against such exploits.
