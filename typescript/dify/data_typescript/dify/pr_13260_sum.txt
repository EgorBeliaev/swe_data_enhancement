### Instructions for Code Modifications

1. **Regular Expression Update:**
   - Implement a regular expression to replace occurrences of `\\n\\n..\\n` and `\\n` within the same line to handle specific line wrapping issues.

2. **Handling Empty Content:**
   - Modify the logic to ensure that both `reasoning_content` and `content` being empty does not inadvertently terminate the reasoning phase or cause `> think_icon` to be appended unnecessarily.

3. **Correct `delta_content` Assignment:**
   - Review and correct the assignment process for `delta_content` within the generic OpenAI API module to ensure the values are properly handled and stored.

### Additional Information

- Follow-up on PR #13234 for any related information or dependencies.
- No changes required for official deepseek API screenshots due to lack of response post-fix for one of the issues.
- Ensure compliance with all PR checklist requirements, including documentation updates and testing coverage.
  
This update is part of a bug-fix related to content handling and display logic in a generic OpenAI API setting. Please integrate and test these changes thoroughly before merging.
