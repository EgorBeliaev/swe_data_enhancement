        "body": "# Summary\r\n\r\nFix Dollar Sign Handling in Markdown, fixes #13149. \r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nRegular text containing dollar signs (e.g., currency values like \"$29 and $199\") was being incorrectly interpreted as LaTeX math expressions, causing rendering issues in the markdown output.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nAdded the `singleDollarTextMath: false` option to the RemarkMath plugin configuration. This ensures that:\r\n- Single dollar signs ($) are treated as regular text characters\r\n- Only double dollar signs ($$) or explicit LaTeX delimiters (\\[...\\] and \\(...\\)) will trigger math expression rendering\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n- Currency values and other text containing dollar signs will now display correctly\r\n- LaTeX math expressions continue to work as expected when properly delimited\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n\r\n| Before                                                                 | After                                                                  |\r\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| ![Screenshot 2025-02-04 084542](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e70e573-91f6-49f6-82b4-38746a59dceb) | ![Screenshot 2025-02-04 084822](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c20a6bf-3b04-415d-bd31-9f9bef43e9a9) |\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> Please review the checklist below before submitting your pull request.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update, included: [Dify Document](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-docs)\r\n- [x] I understand that this PR may be closed in case there was no previous discussion or issues.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find specific information in the Dify repository about how special characters are handled in the output rendering process or any known issues related to this. \n\nHowever, there are existing tests for output formatting in chat and workflows that ensure prompt templates and messages are correctly formatted <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/main/api/tests/unit_tests/core/prompt/test_simple_prompt_transform.py)</sup><sup>[[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/main/web/app/components/base/chat/__tests__/utils.spec.ts)</sup>. These tests might not cover the specific case of special characters like '$', which could be why this issue is occurring.\n\nTo address this, you might want to check the code responsible for rendering the output canvas and see if there are any specific functions or methods that deal with formatting special characters. Additionally, reviewing the configuration settings related to character processing might provide some insights.\n\nIf you have access to the codebase, you could look into the rendering logic to identify where the formatting might be going wrong. Alternatively, you could consider adding a test case that specifically checks for the correct rendering of monetary values or special characters to help identify and fix the issue.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n\n---\n<sup>Help Dosu learn!
