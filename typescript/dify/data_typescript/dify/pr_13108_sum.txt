### Instructions for Changes:

1. **Dynamic Transport Initialization:**
   - Implement fresh `httpx.HTTPTransport` instances for each request when `SSRF_PROXY_HTTP_URL` and `SSRF_PROXY_HTTPS_URL` are configured. 
   - Remove the global `proxy_mounts` variable to stop shared transports across requests, enhancing concurrency safety.

2. **Concurrency Safety:**
   - Address and fix race conditions resulting from reusing the same transports in asynchronous or greenlet contexts. This change is essential to mitigate the `[Errno 9] File descriptor was closed in another greenlet` error in concurrent workflows.

### Description of the Issue Being Fixed:

The PR resolves an issue with the proxy system that doesn't handle multiple concurrent HTTP requests properly, resulting in a `[Errno 9] File descriptor was closed in another greenlet` error. This problem obstructs the simultaneous execution of multiple workflows that perform HTTP requests, as documented in GitHub issue #10572. The fix involves ensuring each request uses its transport instance, eliminating globally shared transports, and resolving race conditions in asynchronous scenarios.
