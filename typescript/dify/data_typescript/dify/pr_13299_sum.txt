### Instructions for the Programmer:

1. **Refactoring:**
   - Replace clauses with methods to improve code structure and readability.
   - Remove any unused variables within the `OpenAICompatible`.

2. **Enhancement:**
   - Add two new methods to the `LargeLanguageModel` to enhance the display of "thinking" content.

3. **HTML Transition:**
   - Replace markdown's `>` with HTML's `<details>` tag for displaying "thinking" content, enabling collapsible functionality and eliminating the need to handle `\n` characters.

4. **Example Implementations:**
   - For model providers using the `<think>` tag (e.g., ollama), update the implementation:
     ```python
     delta_content = delta.get("content") or ""
     delta_content = self._wrap_thinking_by_tag(delta_content)
     ```
   - For model providers using `delta.get("reasoning_content")` (e.g., silicon flow), modify the implementation:
     ```python
     is_reasoning = false
     for ... in llm_response:
         delta_content = self._wrap_thinking_by_reasoning_content(delta, is_reasoning)
     ```

5. **Documentation and Testing:**
   - Ensure documentation is updated to reflect the changes.
   - Add tests for the new changes, ensuring atomicity of each change.
   - Run `dev/reformat` for backend and `cd web && npx lint-staged` for frontend to ensure code linting standards are met.

6. **Checklist:**
   - Confirm that no additional documentation updates are needed, except those already included.
   - Understand that the PR may be closed if there was no prior discussion or issues, excluding typographical errors.
