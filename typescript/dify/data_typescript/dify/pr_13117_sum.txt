The pull request addresses the issue where Dify's integration with Langfuse does not show generation costs. Key changes and instructions for the repository:

1. **Include `total_price` and `model_id`:** Update the code that transforms `Message` objects into a dictionary for `trace_info` to include `total_price` and `model_id`, which are essential for Langfuse to calculate costs.

2. **Instantiate `Message` objects:** Ensure that the code responsible for creating `Message` objects from a dictionary also includes `total_price` and `model_id`.

3. **Optional Data Passing:** While you can pass the model ID alone, consider including the `total_price` if available to ensure accuracy, unless decided otherwise.

4. **Update Documentation:** This change requires an update in the documentation as indicated by the checklist in the PR. Make sure to link to the appropriate Dify documentation.

5. **Lint and Formatting:** Run `dev/reformat` for backend and `cd web && npx lint-staged` for the frontend to ensure code complies with styling guidelines.

6. **Tests and Verification:** While the PR notes that a test was not added, consider adding tests for the changes introduced for robustness, if possible.

This PR closes issue #10684 concerning the inability of Langfuse to calculate model costs due to missing data parameters.
