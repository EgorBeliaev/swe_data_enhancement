Thanks\n\n### 2. Additional context or comments\n\nI'd like to ask, if I enable Function calls when calling Vertex AI, will it cause the error \"[vertex_ai] Error: module 'vertexai.generative_models' has no attribute 'Schema'\", is this my fault, a project defect, or does Vertex AI simply not support function calls?  I would be very grateful if you could answer my question!\n\n### 3. Can you help us with this feature?\n\n- [ ] I am interested in contributing to this feature.",
