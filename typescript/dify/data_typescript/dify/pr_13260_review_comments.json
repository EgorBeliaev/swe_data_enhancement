        "body": "# Summary\r\n\r\nFollow up #13234.\r\n\r\nI've got keys from deepseek and siliconflow. Thus I tested and removed duplicated code.\r\n\r\nI also found two corner cases and one bug:\r\n\r\n1. `\\n\\n..\\n` may be there. That said you can't just replace `\\n\\n` but also `\\n` in the same line. I made a regexp replace.\r\n2. both `reasoning_content` and `content` may be empty sometimes in the thinking phase. the current code will terminate the reasoning phase, append `> think_icon` again.\r\n3.  `delta_content` is not assigned correctly in the generic openai api module.\r\n\r\nSince official deepseek api does not respond after fixing `problem 2`, I don't have screen shots for it.\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n|--------|-------|\r\n| ...    |  ![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 10-32-58 test - Dify](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/733a5d43-9891-43ba-9cd0-e849b6ff905e)  |\r\n| ... |  ![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 10-34-34 test - Dify](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f04f66bc-9e7a-43f0-b22c-6e2f1204e828) |\r\n| ... |  ![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 10-41-53 test - Dify](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/179c2483-75aa-47c5-a281-d1db60681208) |\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> Please review the checklist below before submitting your pull request.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update, included: [Dify Document](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-docs)\r\n- [x] I understand that this PR may be closed in case there was no previous discussion or issues.
