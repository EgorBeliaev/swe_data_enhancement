        "body": "# Summary\r\n\r\nDify's integration with Langfuse doesn't show generation cost.\r\n\r\nCloses #10684 (and probably more similar issues).\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\nThe code that transforms `Message` into dict to attach as `message_data` in `trace_info` object doesn't include `total_price` and `model_id`, which are necessary for Langfuse to calculate the cost. The same is true about the code responsible for instantiating a `Message` object from a dict.\r\n\r\nSome things to be aware of:\r\n- I can pass the model ID alone, and Languse will use this with the rest of the available information to infer the cost, but I thought that it would be better to pass the cost if it is available. Should this be reconsidered?\r\n- [`usage_details` is deprecated](https://python.reference.langfuse.com/langfuse/client#Langfuse.generation)\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"354\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4bfdd5a-191e-4052-a8cd-2ce0b23264b8\" />\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"358\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1bef2d4-e84f-4f56-9be4-895595ed0cf2\" />\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> Please review the checklist below before submitting your pull request.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update, included: [Dify Document](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-docs)\r\n- [x] I understand that this PR may be closed in case there was no previous discussion or issues.

Let's tackle this together!\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThe issue you're experiencing with Langfuse not being able to count the cost of the model in the parameter extractor might be related to how the parameter extractor is integrated or how the data is being tracked. While I don't have specific information on this exact issue, I can provide some insights into how errors are typically handled in the parameter extractor.\n\nWhen the cost calculation fails in the parameter extractor, it usually results in exceptions such as `InvalidArrayValueError`, `InvalidBoolValueError`, and others. These errors are caught and logged, and the process returns a `NodeRunResult` with a failed status <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/main/api/core/workflow/nodes/parameter_extractor/parameter_extractor_node.py)</sup>.\n\nTo troubleshoot, you might want to check the logs for any of these specific errors to see if they provide more context on why the cost isn't being calculated. Additionally, ensure that the integration with Langfuse is correctly set up, as it relies on token usage data for cost calculations <sup>[[2]](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-docs/blob/main/en/guides/monitoring/integrate-external-ops-tools/integrate-langfuse.md)</sup>. If the issue persists, reviewing the configuration settings related to the parameter extractor and Langfuse might help identify any discrepancies.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To continue talking to [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), mention @dosu.*\n"
