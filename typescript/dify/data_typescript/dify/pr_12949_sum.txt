**Instructions:**

1. Implement a feature that wraps the thinking content with Markdown's quote syntax to enhance readability in the DeepSeek-R1 context.
2. Ensure that the fix addresses issue #12891 in the repository [https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/12891](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/issues/12891).
3. Verify that the changes update the `<think>` tag display correctly across different deployments, including those by Ollama.
4. Ensure that all tests covering this change are written and updated accordingly.
5. Run code formatting tools: `dev/reformat` for backend and `cd web && npx lint-staged` for frontend, to ensure code consistency and compliance with linting standards.
6. Update the documentation to reflect these changes as outlined in the [Dify Document](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-docs).

**Note:** Reviews indicate that the deployment by Ollama might still have tag display issues; verify and ensure those are addressed or highlight the need for GPU resources for features that require high processing power.
