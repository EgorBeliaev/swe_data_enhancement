**PR Title:** Fix Dollar Sign Handling in Markdown

**Summary of Changes:**

1. **Problem:** 
   - Regular text with single dollar signs (e.g., "$29 and $199") was mistakenly rendered as LaTeX math expressions. This caused formatting issues in markdown outputs.

2. **Solution:**
   - Modify the `RemarkMath` plugin configuration by adding `singleDollarTextMath: false`. This adjustment ensures:
     - Single dollar signs are treated as ordinary text.
     - Only double dollar signs ($$) or specific LaTeX delimiters (`\[`...\`]` and `\(`...\`)`) will trigger math rendering.

3. **Impact:**
   - Correct display of text with dollar signs.
   - Preserves functionality for properly delimited LaTeX math expressions.

4. **Additional Notes:**
   - Revert changes to `yarn.lock` caused by `npm install`. Leave the lockfile updates to the team managing dependencies.

5. **Testing:**
   - Re-run tests and verify correct rendering as noted.
   - Ensure no new lint errors are present.

This PR addresses the issue where dollar signs in currency values like `$10` and `$20` were incorrectly formatted as expressions. The fix was included to ensure proper text display without HTML rendering issues.
