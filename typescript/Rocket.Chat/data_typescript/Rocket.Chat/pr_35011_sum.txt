To enhance security, update the RSA key size in `FederationKeys.ts` from 512 bits to 2048 bits by changing the line `new NodeRSA({ b: 512 })` accordingly. This ensures compliance with modern cryptographic standards and addresses the security issue indicated in [Code Scanning Alert 399](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/security/code-scanning/399).

Additionally, ensure this PR targets the correct base branch, which should be 7.4.0 instead of 7.3.0. Depending on the project's versioning strategy, assess whether a changeset is necessary. If a version bump is required, follow [changeset documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) for guidance.
