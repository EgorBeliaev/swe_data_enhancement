**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Bug Fix**: Ensure that the `Accounts_CustomFieldsToShowInUserInfo` setting enforces the correct type before using `map()`. This fix is intended to prevent the UI from breaking when an invalid value is provided.

2. **UI Improvement**: Add a better description to the settings in the user interface to enhance understandability.

3. **Branch Target Correction**: Change the PR base branch to `7.4.0` from `7.3.0` as the current target is incorrect.

4. **Dependency Update**: Include changesets that affect 37 packages as listed in the changeset details to be included in the next version bump. Ensure these are correctly marked as 'Patch'.

5. **Testing & Coverage**: Confirm that all modified and coverable lines are properly covered by tests as the Codecov report indicates.

6. **Documentation**: Ensure adherence to the PR guidelines and verify the proposed changes align with the project's contribution documentation and standards.

7. **Issue Reference**: The PR resolves issue [CORE-854]. Confirm correctness of the fix as related to the issue at hand.
