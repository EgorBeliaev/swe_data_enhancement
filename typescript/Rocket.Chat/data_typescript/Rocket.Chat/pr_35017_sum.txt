**Instruction to Programmer:**

1. **Remove Usage of Setting:**
   - Stop using the `Livechat_Room_Count` setting as it's not being used effectively. Plans are underway for a future task to remove it entirely, focusing on ceasing its current usage.

2. **Branch Correction:**
   - Adjust the base target branch from 7.3.0 to 7.4.0 as the PR targets the incorrect branch.

3. **Add Changeset:**
   - Ensure a changeset is added if these modifications warrant a version bump.

4. **Migration Task:**
   - Acknowledge that a separate task will be created to handle the migration and complete removal of this setting, but the current PR will focus only on stopping its use.

The PR is associated with issue [CORE-930](https://rocketchat.atlassian.net/browse/CORE-930) and is currently hindered due to a branch mismatch that needs addressing before merging can proceed.
