**Instruction Summary:**

Fix the `featuresPreview` DB structure issue in the `AccountFeaturePreviewPage.tsx` component:

1. **Adjustment to Save Payload:**
   - Ensure that only `name` and `value` are sent when saving the feature payload.
   - Overwrite these values from the database with default values to facilitate changes without requiring a migration.

2. **Enable Query Rule Update:**
   - Adjust the `enableQuery` rules, which are currently dependent on a feature value linked to an upcoming official feature (Enhanced navigation).

3. **Testing & Validation:**
   - Validate that the changes allow proper modification of the `enableQuery` rules without necessitating a database migration.
   - Verify that the changes do not cause regressions or affect end-user functionality.

This fix addresses the necessity to manage feature settings more flexibly and prepare for transitioning features to official status.
