However, any clients that were inactive during the deployment (e.g., a laptop in sleep mode) do not fetch the updated list upon becoming active again. As a result, these inactive clients continue using outdated actionIds, causing inconsistent and potentially broken interactions.\r\n\r\nSo now, everytime the client goes offline, we invalidate the cache, since the buttons might have changed in the meantime\r\n\r\n## Issue(s)\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR. For example, you can use #594 if this PR closes issue number 594 -->\r\n\r\n## Steps to test or reproduce\r\n<!-- Mention how you would reproduce the bug if not mentioned on the issue page already. Also mention which screens are going to have the changes if applicable -->\r\n\r\nStart with the client active and confirm it fetches updated action buttons upon deployment.\r\nPut the client into an inactive state (e.g., close laptop lid or simulate a network disconnection), then redeploy the app.\r\nReactivate the client and verify that it immediately retrieves the updated action buttons list.\r\nRepeat steps 2-3 for multiple clients to ensure consistent behavior across different endpoints and environments.\r\n\r\nNote: You can use `Meteor.disconnect` to test socket reconnection\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n<!-- If this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc... -->\r\n[CONN-434](https://rocketchat.atlassian.net/browse/CONN-434)\r\n\n\n[CONN-434]: https://rocketchat.atlassian.net/browse/CONN-434?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ"
