### Instructions:

1. **Feature Addition:**
   - Implement a new parameter `forceClose` for the `rooms.closeByUser` endpoint. This parameter allows users to forcefully close an omnichannel conversation when it is in an invalid state, bypassing usual validations.
   - Update relevant API documentation to include the `forceClose` parameter details.

2. **Code Coverage and Testing:**
   - Ensure that all modified lines in the source code are covered by unit tests.
   - Validate that CI checks pass all linting and unit tests.

3. **Versioning and Dependency Updates:**
   - Update the changeset to reflect version bumps in various related packages such as `@rocket.chat/ui-contexts`, `@rocket.chat/ui-client`, and others noted in the changeset bot comment.
   - Ensure that these changes are reflected in the release notes and are ready for the next version bump.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Include necessary changes in documentation to reflect the introduction of the `forceClose` feature.
   - Verify that any changes impacting users or admins are clearly documented, especially regarding the operational implications of the `forceClose` parameter.

5. **PR Completion Readiness:**
   - Confirm that checklist requirements are met, ensuring all dependent changes have been merged and published in downstream modules.
   - Prepare the PR for merging after confirming readiness, as indicated by the automation bots.

By implementing the above instructions, the team ensures that the feature for force closing omnichannel rooms is properly integrated, tested, and documented across the codebase.
