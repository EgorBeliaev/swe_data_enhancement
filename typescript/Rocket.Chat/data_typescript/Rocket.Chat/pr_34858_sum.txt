**Instructions for PR #34858:**

1. **Fix Decoder Error**: Address the issue where `msgpack.decodeStream` throws an error causing the decoder's internal state to become invalid. This prevents the apps-engine from communicating effectively with subprocesses because the decoder retains malformed data.

2. **Instantiate New Decoder**: Modify the engine to create a new decoder instance each time a subprocess is spawned. This ensures that the state of one subprocess's decoder does not affect others and allows communication to be reestablished after a `Decode error`.

3. **Resolve Subprocess Blockage**: Fix the issue on the subprocess side where `stdout` pipe blockage occurs due to the engine's inability to read data. This is causing the OS to block the `write` syscall, leading to an accumulation of outgoing messages.

4. **Base Branch Update**: Correct the base branch from 7.2.0 to 7.3.0 as specified in the dionisio-bot notification.

5. **Handle Backport Conflicts**: Address and resolve conflicts for backporting to version 7.1.1 and 7.0.4. Use the provided git commands to fix these issues:
   ```
   git fetch
   git checkout backport-7.1.1-34858
   git cherry-pick 5506c406f4a22145ece065ad2b797225e94423ca
   ```

6. **Changeset Addition**: Ensure changesets are included to release adjustments as patches to multiple packages listed by changeset-bot including `@rocket.chat/apps-engine`.

7. **Codecov Compliance**: Verify that all modified and coverable lines are covered by tests as reported by Codecov. Ensure to maintain project coverage.

**Issue Fix Summary**:
The PR addresses a critical bug in the Rocket.Chat repository where the msgpack decoder error disrupted inter-process communication by caching malformed data, thus requiring a fix for decoder re-initialization per subprocess and handling of stdout stream errors.
