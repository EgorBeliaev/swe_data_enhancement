### Instructions for Programmer:

1. **Fix Exception in Rate Limiting Logic**:
   - Update the `shouldAddRateLimitToRoute` function in `Rocket.Chat/apps/meteor/app/api/server/api.ts` to ensure both `numRequestsAllowed` and `intervalTimeInMS` properties are defined before proceeding. This will prevent uncaught exceptions.
   - Add a fallback value for `intervalTimeInMS` in the `users.register` route to prevent crashes on new server setups:
     ```javascript
     intervalTimeInMS: settings.get('API_Enable_Rate_Limiter_Limit_Time_Default') ?? 600000,
     ```

2. **Review for Consistency**:
   - Ensure that the fallback value `600000` for `intervalTimeInMS` aligns with other default settings. Compare with `60000` mentioned in `API_RATE_LIMIT` settings to check for possible discrepancies.

3. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Test on a fresh server instance (`yarn dsv`) to confirm error handling and fallback values perform as expected without triggering an application crash.
   - Confirm all modified and coverable lines are covered by tests, maintaining coverage at 59.22%.

4. **Changeset Consideration**:
   - Determine if the changes require a version bump. If necessary, add a changeset for version management.

5. **Clarification**:
   - Address inquiries regarding the difference between the fallback value set to `600000` and the default value `60000` in the API_RATE_LIMIT setting to ensure clarity and consistency.

This change will fix issue [SB-763] by preventing server crashes due to unhandled exceptions in rate limiting logic.
