### Instruction for the Programmer:

1. **Fix Unhandled Error**:
   - Implement a `try/catch` block to handle unhandled promise rejections when adding or refreshing OAuth apps. This will prevent server crashes due to race conditions when an ID is fetched from MongoDB but is not yet present.

2. **Testing**:
   - Verify the fix by running the latest version of RocketChat. Test the functionalities of adding and refreshing OAuth apps to ensure the server no longer crashes during these operations.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update the changeset as requested by KevLehman to categorize this as a fix rather than a chore.

4. **Merge Readiness**:
   - Ensure all modified and coverable lines remain covered by tests, as confirmed by Codecov. Follow the PR guidelines to proceed with the merge if no other issues are present.
