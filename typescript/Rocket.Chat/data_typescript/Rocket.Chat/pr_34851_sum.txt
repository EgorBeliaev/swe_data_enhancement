1. **Change Usage of Fields:** Modify the code to use the `files` (array) field from messages instead of the deprecated `file` field when processing all uploads associated with a message that should be deleted.

2. **Fix Deletion Logic:** Ensure that when a room is deleted, all uploads related to the messages in that room, including thumbnails, are fully removed from the `rocketchat_uploads` collection and the selected storage type.

3. **Update Target Branch:** Change the PR's target base branch from `7.2.0` to `7.3.0` as indicated by the automation feedback.

4. **Improve Test Coverage:** Address the missing coverage for 2 lines of code to improve the patch coverage, aiming for 100% coverage on the changes made.

5. **Verify Changes with Test Steps:**
   - Upload an image in a room.
   - Delete the room.
   - Confirm that the image and its thumbnail are deleted from the `rocketchat_uploads` collection.
