This pull request addresses an issue where inactive clients do not refresh action buttons after app deployment. The bug occurs because inactive clients, such as those that are offline or in sleep mode during deployment, do not fetch updated action buttons once they become active again. This inconsistency leads to outdated action button usage and potential broken interactions.

The implemented fix ensures that every time a client goes offline, the cache is invalidated. This way, upon reactivation, the client fetches the updated action buttons list immediately, ensuring consistent behavior across different clients. 

Testing steps include:
1. Ensure an active client fetches updated action buttons upon app deployment.
2. Simulate client inactivity (e.g., network disconnection), redeploy the app, and then reactivate the client to verify it retrieves the updates.
3. Repeat the process for multiple clients to confirm consistent behavior.
