The Pull Request (PR) addresses the following issue in the repository:

### Issue:
The files contextual bar was not handling the reactivity of incoming messages properly due to reliance on `upload` objects of type `IUpload`, for which there are no stream events for incoming uploads.

### Changes:
- **Fix**: The PR removes the reactivity from the files contextual bar to rectify this bug, ensuring the contextual bar does not depend on `upload` objects for handling message events.

### Testing & Verification:
- Ensure that the files contextual bar no longer attempts to react to incoming message events via `upload` objects.
- Verify that the fix resolves the reactivity handling error without introducing new issues.
- Ensure that existing tests pass and confirm coverage is maintained as shown in the Codecov Report.

### Additional Information:
