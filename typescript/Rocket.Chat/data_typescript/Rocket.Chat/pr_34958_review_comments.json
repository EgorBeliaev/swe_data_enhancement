This happens because there were some actions in between the room creation and the inquiry creation that could fail, leaving a room with no inquiry. There was the posibiity of the inquiry creation failing, which would leave the room orphaned as well.\r\n\r\nSince now both are in a transaction, they should be always created altogether, making it safer and less error prone.\r\n## Issue(s)\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.
