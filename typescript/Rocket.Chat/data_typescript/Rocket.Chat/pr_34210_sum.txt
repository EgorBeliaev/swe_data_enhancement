The PR addresses a bug where new livechat conversations are not automatically assigned to the contact manager. 

**Instructions for the Programmer:**

1. Modify the livechat room assignment logic to prioritize the `contactManager` property found in **contacts** over the now-deprecated `contactManager` field in visitors.
2. Ensure this change affects all livechats initiated in a **Premium** workspace with "Assign new conversations to the contact manager" enabled under **Settings > Omnichannel > Routing**.
3. Verify that if the contact manager is online, they are automatically assigned to the room.
4. Use "Auto Selection" as the "Omnichannel Routing Method" for correct behavior; otherwise, only bot contact managers will be auto-assigned.
5. Update tests to cover new assignment logic ensuring line coverage remains at 100% for modified logic as current project coverage is at 75.27%.
6. Note: Address change request to target base branch 7.3.0 instead of 7.2.0.

**Issue Being Fixed:**

New livechat conversations were not assigned to contact managers accurately due to reliance on outdated fields, affecting functionality in premium workspaces for routing settings.
