The pull request addresses an issue with the `/settings` endpoint by re-enabling the ability to fetch the `packageValue` of settings which was lost after the deprecation of the `fields` parameter. The solution introduces a new boolean flag named `includeDefaults` to allow users to retrieve both the default and current values of settings via this endpoint. The changes also ensure that affected packages receive the fix as a patch.
