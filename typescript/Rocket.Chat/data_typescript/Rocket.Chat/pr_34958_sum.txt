### Instruction for the Programmer:

1. **Branch Correction**: Change the base branch of this PR from `7.3.0` to `7.4.0` as specified by the bot feedback.

2. **Transaction Implementation**: Implement transactional creation of Omnichannel rooms and inquiries. This ensures that a room is never created without an inquiry and aims to prevent orphaned rooms caused by actions timing out. Both room and inquiry should be created simultaneously within a transaction for better error handling.

3. **Test and Verification**: Ensure all modifications are thoroughly tested locally, as indicated by the PR checklist. Use the provided Codecov report to verify that all new or modified lines are covered by tests.

4. **Changeset Handling**: Verify that a changeset has been added to this PR to ensure that version bumps and releases include the changes in the proper packages. The major, minor, and patch changes for various packages have been listed by the changeset-bot.
