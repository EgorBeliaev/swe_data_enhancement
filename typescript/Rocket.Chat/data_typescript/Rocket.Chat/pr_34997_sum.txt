**Instruction for Programmer:**

- Update the `useQueries` hook to align with the changes made in the latest version of `@tanstack/useQuery` library. This update resolves the issue of mentioning users who have no messages in a room, likely introduced as a regression. 
- Add a test case to cover this specific regression to ensure similar issues are caught in the future.
- There are no additional changeset requirements for a version bump; however, ensure that the existing coverage is maintained.

**Issue Fixed:**

The PR addresses a regression issue where updating the `@tanstack/useQuery` library led to a malfunction in the application's mention feature, particularly when users with no prior messages in a chat room are mentioned.
