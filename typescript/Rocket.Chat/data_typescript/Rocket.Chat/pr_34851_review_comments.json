Check the `rocketchat_uploads` collection to make sure both documents related to the image have been deleted (the image itself and the thumbnail).\r\n**Current behavior:** the image itself is deleted, but RC keeps the thumbnail in the `rocketchat_uploads` collection and in the selected storage type.\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n<!-- If this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc... -->\r\n[SUP-715]\r\n\r\n[SUP-715]: https://rocketchat.atlassian.net/browse/SUP-715?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ"
