This essentially rendered the whole apps-engine incapable of communication, as the decoder instance was shared among apps.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, now the engine will instantiate a new decoder every time it spawns a subprocess. This guarantees that the internal state of the decoder for a subprocess will never impact the communication of other subprocesses, and also allows the engine to reestablish communication with a new subprocess of an app after a `Decode error`.\r\n\r\nAnother side effect of this problem could be observed on the subprocess side. Since the engine stopped reading data from the subprocess' `stdout` pipe, the operation system was blocking the `write` syscall that the subprocess made and essentially made it stuck with an ever growing queue of ougoing messages.\r\n\r\nNote: I've also tried reestablishing the communication over the same pipe that we had with the subprocess - since the state of the subprocess wasn't invalid, it made sense to try that. However, the msgpack decoder left the `stdout` stream of the ChildProcess in an unrecoverable error state, so I was left with restarting the whole subprocess.\r\n## Issue(s)\r\n<!-- Link the issues being closed by or related to this PR.
