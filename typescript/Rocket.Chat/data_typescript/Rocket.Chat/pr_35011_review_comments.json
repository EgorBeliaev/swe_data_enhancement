This change will ensure that the generated keys are secure and comply with modern cryptographic standards.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we will update the line `new NodeRSA({ b: 512 })` to use a key size of 2048 bits. This change will not affect the existing functionality of the code but will enhance the security of the generated keys.\r\n\r\nhttps://rocketchat.atlassian.net/browse/VLN-92\r\n"
