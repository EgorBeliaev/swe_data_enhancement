**Instructions for Repository Update:**

1. Implement a null-check in the code to safely handle the scenario where the Sprite Asset has not been set in TMPro settings. This prevents an error that stops the UIEffect feature from drawing a warning message when the text object is selected.
2. Ensure that this null-check is applied wherever the Sprite Asset is accessed or utilized within the UIEffect component to maintain consistent error handling and application stability.

**Issue Description:** 

The repository currently encounters an error if the UIEffect is used when the Sprite Asset field in TMPro settings is left empty. This error stops TMPro warning messages from being drawn correctly. The proposed fix introduces a null-check to prevent this error from occurring.
