This pull request introduces a new feature that allows users to use non-HDR color pickers for gradient color fields. The motivation is to address difficulties with HDR color pickers in some Unity versions where HEX color fields are absent and color spaces may not match. Key changes include:

1. **Feature Addition:**
   - Added an option to toggle between HDR and non-HDR color fields for `horizontal`, `vertical`, `radial (fast and detail)`, `diagonal to right bottom`, `diagonal to left bottom`, and `angle` gradients via a checkbox (`HDR Gradient`) in the UI Effects settings.
   - HDR functionality now extends to `Color Filter > Color`, `Transition Filter > Transition Color`, and `Shadow Mode > Shadow Color`.
   - The `UIEFFECTS_GRADIENT_NO_HDR` flag has been replaced with a field within `UIEffectProjectSettings`.

2. **Implementation Changes:**
   - The `UIEffectEditor` reads a static property from `UIEffectProjectSettings` to override color picker drawers through IMGUI, eliminating the need for recompilation when toggling the HDR option.

3. **Code Quality and Style:**
   - Code has been formatted according to the project's `.editorconfig` style guidelines.

4. **Single Source of Truth (SSOT):**
   - `HDR Gradient` option is saved within `UIEffectProjectSettings`.
   - Utilization of `InitializeOnLoad` ensures consistency across platform changes.

This PR is set to be included in version 5.2.0 of the repository.
