        "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nAdded an option to use non-HDR color fields on gradation color 1 and 2\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nIn some versions of Unity, HDR color pickers doesn't have a HEX color field. This makes pasting colors somewhat difficult if a game uses an external design software.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, HDR color pickers may not be in the same color space as the non-HDR color fields, making the color in the field preview inaccurate.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nNone added\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)  \r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)  \r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Update documentations\r\n- [ ] Others (refactoring, style changes, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Test environment\r\n\r\n- Platform: Editor(Windows)\r\n- Unity version: 2020.3.48f1\r\n- Build options: Mono, .Net Standard 2.0, BIRP\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] This pull request is for merging into the `develop` branch\r\n- [X] My code follows the style guidelines of this project\r\n- [X] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [X] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [X] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [X] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [X] I have checked my code and corrected any misspellings\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9938d45-ccb1-4e8a-819d-01329cda637a)\r\n"

        "body": "Thank you for your PR!  \r\nIt includes detailed explanations and documentation updates, which is fantastic! \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\n- To unify user experience, it would be even better if the ability to enable/disable HDR mode were extended not just to Gradient Color 1 and 2 but to all configurable colors:\r\n  - Color Filter > Color\r\n  - Transition Filter > Transition Color\r\n  - Shadow Mode > Shadow Color\r\n- Please apply the code style (indentation and spacing) defined in the `.editorconfig` file.\r\n- From an SSOT (Single Source of Truth) perspective, `HDR Gradient` should be saved in `UIEffectProjectSettings`. Additionally, the `InitializeOnLoad` attribute should be used to set the `ScriptingDefineSymbol` as needed.  \r\n  - This ensures the same settings can be restored even when switching platforms or if a commit was missed."

        "body": "Thanks for reviewing!  \r\nI decided to replace the scripting define with a field inside `UIEffectProjectSettings`. The `UIEffectEditor` then reads the exposed static property to override the color picker drawers through IMGUI.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cd442f0-38f9-434e-b87f-257a5ac353db)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad5e77ff-d6dc-475f-87c4-accda050cece)\r\n\r\nThis removes the need to recompile the code whenever that option is toggled, and follows the SSOT principle.  \r\nI've also reformatted the UIEffect script according to the project format."
