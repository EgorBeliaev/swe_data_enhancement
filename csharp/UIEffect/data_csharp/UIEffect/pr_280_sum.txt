Add a new option called "StartMode" to the UIEffectTweener component. This option should allow users to set it to "manual" mode, preventing the tweener effect from playing automatically on start. In "manual" mode, the effect should only begin once `Play()` is called on UIEffectTweener. Retain the existing "automatic" mode for default behavior. Ensure that the new feature does not disrupt Normal/Unscaled update modes. Update corresponding documentation and follow the project's coding standards.
