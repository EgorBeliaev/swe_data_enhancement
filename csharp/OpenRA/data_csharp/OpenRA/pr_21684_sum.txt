The pull request addresses an issue where the `HasProperty` method returns true for "Location" and "Facing" properties on actors that do not actually have these properties, such as the player actor, leading to script crashes. The fix involves not binding bogus "Location" or "Facing" Lua properties for these actors. Testing can be done by adding the provided snippet to the RA shellmap's `WorldLoaded` function to ensure no crashes occur when accessing "Location" properties. Additional similar bug fixes in `GeneralProperties` are noted, but are not addressed in this PR due to potential breaking changes in the API.
