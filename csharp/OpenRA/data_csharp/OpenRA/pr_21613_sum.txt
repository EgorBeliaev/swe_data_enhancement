**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. Introduce a `UpdateVisibilityNextTick` flag for each `FrozenActor` to track when a visibility update is necessary, allowing the elimination of the `dirtyFrozenActorIds` set in `FrozenActorLayer`.
2. Modify the `Tick` method to avoid performing a set lookup for improved performance.
3. Only instantiate the `frozenActorsToRemove` list when it is required to prevent unnecessary memory allocation.
4. Ensure these changes close issue #21596.
