This PR changes the script to use the internal names.\r\n\r\nThere is something similar happening with the tooltip for the modified Outpost here and in `harkonnen-05`. I'm less certain how that should be handled.\r\n\r\n![d2k-2025-01-15T232224028Z](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac60647d-32cf-4101-9ac3-565383efaa9c)\r\n![d2k-2025-01-15T231805945Z](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a424a7df-4bdd-4141-9517-eb84b2d039db)\r\n\r\nThe shellmap script makes use of localized bot names, but not in a way that seems to cause problems.\r\n"
