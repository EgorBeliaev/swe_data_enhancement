Title: Fix illegal ore rings popping up around spawns in generated maps

Instructions:
- Reorder and group the selective clearing of the resource placement plan to `-int.MaxValue`.
- This change is necessary to prevent subsequent code from using the plan in arithmetic, avoiding potential underflows that could cause resources to appear in illegal locations.
- Ensure this fix addresses the regression issues discussed in PRs #21718 and #21721, particularly with reference to the comments and review linked in the discussion.

Issue Being Fixed:
This PR addresses a bug where ore rings appear in illegal positions around spawn points on generated maps due to arithmetic underflow when inappropriate values are used in resource placement calculations.
