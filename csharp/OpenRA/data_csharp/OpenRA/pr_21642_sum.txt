Refactor the editor's internal clipboard logic into a reusable "Blitting" functionality by:

1. Reworking the `CopySelectionContents` method as `CopyRegionContents` to optimize actor processing and prevent unnecessary cell looping.
2. Deduplicating repeated code to streamline functionality.
3. Implementing minor code simplifications and renaming various components to improve clarity and maintainability.

Ensure that there are no expected user-visible changes, as this refactor serves as groundwork for future enhancements.
