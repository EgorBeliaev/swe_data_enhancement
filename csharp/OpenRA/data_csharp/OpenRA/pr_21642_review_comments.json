        "body": "- Refactors internal editor clipboard logic into reusable map contents \"Blitting\" functionality.\r\n- Fix actor processing being unnecessarily (cell) looped within CopySelectionContents (now CopyRegionContents).\r\n- Deduplicates largely repeated code.\r\n- Minor code simplifications and renames.\r\n\r\nThis is a refactor with no expected user-visible changes. These changes have been split out from #21637 and are ultimately motivated by that work.\r\n"

After doing a lot of operations was able to undo and redo parts of as well as the whole history stack and get the same output. This passing is TS gives me confidence it's working okay with isometric and height."
