The PR titled "Fix bounding of circle drawing in CellLayerUtils" addresses the following:

1. Updates the code to accurately handle bounding calculations for circle drawing not only for the RectangularIsometric case but potentially for other cases as well, improving upon previous handling which was specific to Rectangular mode. 
2. Adjusts the calculation to not be too tight, ensuring more accurate bounding behavior during circle drawing.

This PR fixes an issue with bounding calculations, although the discussion also includes feedback indicating other unrelated issues (such as terrain impacting playability and the seed text field issue), which are acknowledged to be outside the scope of this PR.
