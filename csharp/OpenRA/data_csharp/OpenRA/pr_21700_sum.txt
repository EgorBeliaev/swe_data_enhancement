**Instructions for Change:**

Ensure the MiniYaml keys within the tileset files are consistent:

1. Update the `Template@...` numbers to match the `Id: ...` values within the same scope if an `Id` exists.
2. Verify changes with the provided validation script:
   ```bash
   paste <(grep -Po '(?<=\\tTemplate\\@)([1-9]|[0-9]{2,})(?=\\:$)' mods/*/tilesets/*.yaml) <(grep -Poh '(?<=\\t\\tId: {0,9})([1-9]|[0-9]{2,})$' mods/*/tilesets/*.yaml) | tr ':' '\\t' | awk '$2 != $3'
   ```
3. Focus specifically on the tilesets within the `mods/cnc/tilesets/snow.yaml` and `mods/cnc/tilesets/winter.yaml` files, ensuring the IDs match as outlined in the script output:
   - `snow.yaml` adjustments: Change `188` to `189`, `189` to `190`, `190` to `191`, `191` to `192`.
   - `winter.yaml` adjustments: Change `188` to `189`, `189` to `190`, `190` to `191`, `191` to `192`.

No behavioral changes are expected from these modifications.
