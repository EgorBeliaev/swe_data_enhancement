**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Objective**: Add a fuzzer for map generation testing to identify crashes and measure map rejection frequency. It is intended for manual use due to its time-consuming nature when run with extensive settings.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - The fuzzer discards all generated maps immediately after generation (in-memory only).
   - It is not integrated into the regular test suite but available for manual invocation.

3. **Example Use Cases**:
   - To test map generation with various seeds and configurations using specific tilesets and map sizes. Examples are provided for:
     - Testing against all tilesets with specific seeds and map sizes.
     - Testing map shapes and symmetries with a single tileset.
     - Testing different terrain types.

4. **Outcome**:
   - Approximately 30% of maps are rejected due to the playable space restriction.
   - Refer to the provided changelog link for detailed comparisons between recent commits.

Ensure the scripts mentioned in the examples are accurately implemented to support detailed testing scenarios and adapt them as needed for specific testing requirements.
