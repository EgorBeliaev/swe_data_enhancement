**Instructions for Repository Maintenance:**

1. Maintain the `<NuGetAuditMode>` setting to cover indirect dependencies, despite the CVE warnings, as it offers value in being aware of potential issues.

2. Avoid downgrading the Windows version or .NET SDK to bypass these warnings. Instead, explore using `global.json` to specify a desired SDK version, noting the constraints with the `rollForward` feature.

3. Acknowledge that changing the targeted SDK in `global.json` wonâ€™t alter the default `<NuGetAuditMode>` setting since .NET 9 will still handle the compilation. Ensure the specified SDK version is installed to avoid command execution failures.

**Issue Being Addressed:**

This PR addresses the occurrence of unrelated CVE warnings resulting from a change in the default `<NuGetAuditMode>` setting to `all` in .NET, specifically when maintaining these settings at the project level isn't possible downstream.
