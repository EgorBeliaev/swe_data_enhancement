**Instructions for Changes in Map Generator Spawn Placement**

1. **Spacing Adjustments**:
   - Relax the spacing requirement between sequentially placed spawns.
   - Ensure symmetry-projected spawns have equal separation as sequentially placed ones.

2. **Placement Rules**:
   - Factor rotations in anti-center biasing calculations.
   - Use a linear falloff instead of a binary one for anti-center biasing.

3. **Buildable Area Enforcement**:
   - Enforce a minimum buildable area around spawns:
     - 9x9 buildable area for standard terrains.
     - 7x7 buildable area for Oceanic and Narrow Wetlands.

4. **Fallback and Spacing Preservation**:
   - Preserve spacing information when using center space fallback decisions.

5. **Spawn Conditions and Exceptions**:
   - Allow spawn placement on or near roads.
   - Fix issue with spawn mines overstating space reservation contributions.

6. **Invalid Spawns Handling**:
   - Add a check to ensure spawns have a buildable radius of at least 5 cells to be considered valid.
   - Spawns situated in unplayable areas such as next to water or too confined should be revised.

Address the described regressions and ensure the areas provided for spawns are playable to prevent generation failures, especially in auto-map generation contexts.
