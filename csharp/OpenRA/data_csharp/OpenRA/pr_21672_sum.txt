### Issue Addressed
The PR addresses the issue with the battlefield news text display layout when messages are short. Specifically, it focuses on enhancing the visual balance by adjusting the top and bottom spacing, which affects how the text aligns and the overall height of the news panel.

### Instructions for Changes
1. **Adjust News Panel Height**:
   - Modify the calculation of the news panel's height to improve bottom spacing for better visual balance.
   - Implement the following code change:
     ```diff
     -newsPanel.Bounds.Height = Math.Min(newsPanel.ContentHeight, maxNewsHeight);
     +newsPanel.Bounds.Height = Math.Min(newsPanel.ContentHeight + 5, maxNewsHeight);
     ```

2. **Align Text Horizontally**:
   - Investigate the horizontal alignment of text as it remains unaligned even after height adjustments.
   - Note that, while the spacing adjustment is suggested, further refinement may be necessary for perfect alignment.

### Additional Notes
- An optical illusion regarding spacing sizes, as mentioned, is not automatically resolved by these changes and may require additional model rewrites for complete resolution.
- Visual changes should be confirmed by comparing with screenshots provided in the PR to ensure alignment with design expectations.
