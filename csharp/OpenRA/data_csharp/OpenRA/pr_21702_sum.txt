Add CnC map generator support with configurations for all tilesets similar to RA. 

**Instructions:**
1. Ensure that map generation supports all tilesets, focusing on a comparable level of support as the RA generator.
2. Modify the DESERT tileset configuration to support water-related terrain settings, understanding the limitations due to no naval gameplay in CnC.
3. Review and integrate changes from pull request #21700 first as it is a dependency.
4. Address the excessive generation of snow on snowy maps by adjusting MultiBrush weights.
5. Plan to introduce additional map details (actors, roads, rivers) in a future PR, avoiding substantial changes within this one.
6. Investigate and potentially enhance temperate tileset generation performance to prevent bottlenecking, particularly in large maps.
7. Diagnose and refine handling of beach templates and prevent crashes caused by bounds in water.
8. Implement fixes for bugs identified, such as beach errors (reference PR #21704).
9. Increase the density of road generation, potentially using adjustments referenced in PR #21705.
