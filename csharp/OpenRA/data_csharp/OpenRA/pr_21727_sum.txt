**Instruction:**

Fix the overflow issue in the `CalibrateQuantileInPlace` method of the `MatrixUtils` class, which occurs in the `OpenRA.Mods.Common.MapGenerator` namespace. This issue results in a `System.IndexOutOfRangeException` when generating large maps, specifically at 256x256 size. The error is reported at `MatrixUtils.cs`, line 719 and propagates through `RaMapGenerator.cs`, line 755.
