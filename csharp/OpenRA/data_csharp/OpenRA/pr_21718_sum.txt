**Instructions for PR Changes:**

1. **Remove Floating Points**: Eliminate all floating point usage from the `RaMapGenerator` and its dependencies to ensure consistent map generation across different hardware and software environments. 

2. **Adjust Numerical Representations**:
   - Change fractional public-facing settings to integers, using scales of 1000 (some exceptions use 1000000).
   - Convert internal fixed-point logic to use 1024ths or appropriate discrete approximations (e.g., use binomial instead of gaussian).

3. **Regression Fixes**:
   - Addressed regression affecting snow presentation on winter maps by correcting weight values.
   - Fix an `IndexOutOfRangeException` in the `MatrixUtils.CalibrateQuantileInPlace` method by ensuring calculations use `long` for safe index calculations:
     ```csharp
     var adjustment = target - sorted[(sorted.Length - 1) * count / outOf];
     ```
   - Rectify an issue with circular ore rings appearing in water due to insufficient space for starting resources.

4. **Testing**:
   - Additional validation required for regression issues, particularly testing configurations such as RA, Desert, 256x256, Seed 1 to ensure robustness.

Ensure all systemic changes are thoroughly tested with a focus on edge case scenarios where exceptions were previously noted.
