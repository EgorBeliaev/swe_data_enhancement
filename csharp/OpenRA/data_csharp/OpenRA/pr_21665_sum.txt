The issue in this PR revolves around correcting the handling of production queues and related traits for both individual actors (per-actor production) and the owning player actor (per-player production) in the `BaseBuilderBotModule.LocomotorsForProducibles` module. Key changes include:

1. **Fix Trait Resolution**: Update how the `Production` and `ProductionQueue` traits are resolved to correctly address both per-actor and per-player scenarios.

2. **Add Trait Checks**: Ensure that checks for trait status are in place. Specifically, incorporate a `!p.IsTraitDisabled` check to handle traits that may be temporarily disabled.

3. **Add Dead/Disposed Checks**: Introduce checks for whether an actor is dead (`IsDead`) or disposed before setting rally points to avoid crashes. 

4. **Update Per-Queue Setup Handling**: Modify code to account for both per-player and per-actor queue setups, ensuring all production check paths are handled correctly.

These changes aim to address issues where AI incorrectly places spawn points in unreachable positions and crashes related to accessing traits from non-existent objects. Also included is an added condition to handle actors that die after setting but before executing rally points, ensuring robustness against state changes in actor life.
