Implement covariant return types for method overrides utilizing C# 9 features, specifically for `Widget.Clone()` and similar methods, to enhance the type specificity of return values. This change will eliminate the need for certain casts by providing richer type information. This is now feasible due to the previous mono runtime limitation being removed in PR #21682.
