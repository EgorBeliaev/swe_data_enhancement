**Issue Description:**

The pull request addresses a bug where harvesters refuse to allow queuing up docking orders when those orders become temporarily invalid. This is problematic because, by the time the queued dock order is executed, it may become valid again. 

A detailed report of this issue was originally shared on Discord. The PR intends to ensure docking orders can be queued even if they are initially flagged as invalid, allowing for potential validation at execution time.
