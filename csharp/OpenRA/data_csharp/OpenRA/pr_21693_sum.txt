### Instructions for Implementing AutoSave in OpenRA:

1. **Add AutoSave Support**:
   - Implement the initial support for auto-save by adding `AutoSaveOption.cs`.

2. **Code Placement Adjustments**:
   - Remove code related to the `SinglePlayer` menu from `Options` as it has been added to `Settings`.

3. **Adjust Fluent Strings**:
   - Update `GamePlaySettingsLogic` so that the auto-save-interval options are correctly represented. Ensure that intervals are displayed depending on duration: "Disabled", "10 seconds", "30 seconds", "45 seconds", "1 minute", and "x minutes". Resolve the issue with `{ $seconds / 60 }`.

4. **AutoSave Files**:
   - Ensure a maximum file limit is set to auto-save files to prevent unlimited saving. The feature should delete older files after reaching the limit.

5. **Testing Considerations**:
   - Test for fault scenarios such as a full disk to ensure there are no stack traces, crashes, or issues when the disk is not writable.
   - Consider testing how long the save takes on average and simulate scenarios with full disk partitions.

6. **Workflow Integration**:
   - Review and integrate with the existing workflow before final deployment.

The main issue being addressed by this PR is the implementation and integration of an automatic save feature while ensuring the application handles edge cases such as disk space limitations and efficient file management.
