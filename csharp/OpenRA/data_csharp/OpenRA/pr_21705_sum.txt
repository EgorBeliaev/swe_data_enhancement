### Instructions for Programmer:

1. **Enhance Roads in Map Generation:**
   - Extend roads beyond map bounds.
   - Prune shorter, nonviable roads and merge to create longer roads.
   - Allow roads to loop.

2. **Crash Fixes:**
   - Fix crash occurring on winter lakes, ocean, and temperate parks maps related to "Index was out of range" and "Index was outside the bounds of the array" exceptions.
   - Address issues around non-trivial rotations causing crashes, with ongoing investigation and possible fixes in separate PRs.

3. **Pending Tasks and Considerations:**
   - Investigate and potentially resolve resources appearing out of bounds during the "clear brush" process. This might be related to the red alert map "Imminent Destruction" and is not crucial to this PR.
   - Consider an adjustment mechanism for ore beneath roads to nudge ore away.
   - Investigate scarcity of roads on mountain maps â€” adjustments are expected to be managed via configuration changes in later updates.
   - Scope creep items including the addition of details to plain, puddle, and lake maps are suggested to be handled in separate PRs.

4. **Documentation and Tracking:**
   - Document resolved and pending issues, and improvements, perhaps in a tracking issue for clarity and prioritization of future enhancements.

5. **Additional Notes:**
   - Ensure to automate testing processes to catch issues effectively.
   - Follow up on linked issue #21707 for the second crash and dependencies related to PR #21704.

This PR updates the map generation to produce more complex and feature-rich road layouts while addressing specific map-related crashes. Further improvements are expected to be deployed in subsequent updates through separate PRs.
