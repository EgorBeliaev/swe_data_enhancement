### Instructions for the Programmer:

1. **Issue Addressed:** This PR closes issue #36032 by adding divide by zero handling for hexadecimal numbers in the calculator plugin.

2. **Change Implementation:**
   - Ensure handling is in place for scenarios involving division by zero with hexadecimal inputs (e.g., `1 / 0x0`).
   - Even if a division by zero occurs, the system should not crash but instead return NaN (Not a Number) or an appropriate error message.

3. **Validation:**
   - Perform both automated and manual tests to ensure that the reported scenario is fixed. Verify additional arbitrary equations for correctness.
   - Evaluate expression parsing to ensure cases like `1 / (1 - 1)` are checked efficiently and not just using basic methods like regex.

4. **Additional Checklist Items (Pending):**
   - Discuss changes with core contributors for feedback.
   - Complete and verify tests that are updated or added.
   - Ensure all user-facing strings are localizable.
   - Include necessary documentation updates and refer to them in the linked documentation repo if made.

5. **Pipeline Considerations:**
   - Ensure new binaries and necessary scripts are properly added to relevant pipeline configurations (e.g., JSON for signing, WXS for installer, YML for CI pipeline).

### Note:
Feedback from `jaimecbernardo` confirms that the changes will result in showing an appropriate error message instead of causing a crash.
