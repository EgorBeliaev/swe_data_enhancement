What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\r\n## Summary of the Pull Request\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/commit/20a5f67222f74c687a08aa4d3bf1ba8c978faf86, when trying to run Peek Monaco preview on a release installer, there's a crash on WebView 2.\r\nThis seems to be caused by the MonacoHelper not recognizing it's on the WinUI3Apps directory.\r\n`Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location)` was replaced by `AppContext.BaseDirectory` on https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/commit/20a5f67222f74c687a08aa4d3bf1ba8c978faf86 , but the latter includes a stray directory separator at the end that must be removed for the remaining logic to make sense.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\r\n## Validation Steps Performed\r\nBuilt a release installer and tested Monaco on both Peek and the file preview handler.\r\n"

So, I can test it in the future.\r\n> \r\n> Anyway, approve this PR to repair it.\r\n\r\n@moooyo It's basically only when we test a release build from an installer, because that ships only PowerToys/Assets/Monaco and not PowerToys/WinUI3Apps/Assets/Monaco. On builds from VS, \"PowerToys/WinUI3Apps/Assets/Monaco\" is still created automatically by the build, but we only ship one since they're the same."
