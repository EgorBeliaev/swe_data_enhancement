**Instruction for Programmer:**

Add the hotkey for PowerToys Run to the `LauncherShowEvent` so that telemetry data can capture the frequency of different hotkeys used to activate PowerToys Run. Ensure validation by verifying that the hotkey is included in the telemetry events, and check this with the "View Diagnostic Data" feature turned on.
