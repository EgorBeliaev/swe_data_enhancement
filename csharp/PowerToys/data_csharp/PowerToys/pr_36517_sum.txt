The pull request introduces the `ContextMenuResult` functionality to the `Run.Plugin.VSCodeWorkspaces` plugin to resolve Issue #35773. Here are the detailed instructions and tasks for the programmer:

1. **Resolve Feedback**: A reviewer mentioned there are issues to be fixed before proceeding.
2. **Testing**: Ensure all tests are added or updated and passing successfully.
3. **Localization**: Confirm that all user-facing strings can be localized.
4. **Documentation**: Update developer and end-user documentation. If checked, file a separate pull request to the documentation repository and provide its reference.
5. **Binaries and Integration**:
   - Include new binaries in the necessary locations. Specifically:
     - Update the JSON for signing new binaries.
     - Modify the WXS file for the installer to include new binaries and localization resources.
     - Adjust the YML configuration for the continuous integration pipeline for any new test projects.
     - Edit the YML for the signed pipeline as needed for completion.

6. **Code Refactoring**: There's a possible concern about a refactor of `HandleError`â€”consider revisiting this area, though it wasn't marked as an issue by the final reviewer.

7. **CLA Agreement**: Ensure that the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is agreed upon following the instructions for indicating your company, if applicable.

This pull request needs a final review from the core team after the adjustments are made.
