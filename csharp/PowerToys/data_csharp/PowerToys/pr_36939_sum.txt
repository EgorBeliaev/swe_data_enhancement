### Summary of Changes to be Made:
1. **Add "New" Labels:**
   - Insert "New" in the navigation for `System Tools` and `ZoomIt` to highlight new utilities.

2. **Styling Adjustments:**
   - Revise the `px size` of some elements to align with the general recommendation to use multiples of four. Change `5px` to `4px`.

3. **Dashboard Card:**
   - Implement the "New" badge on the dashboard.
   - Align the badge on the dashboard card to the right side, placing it between the label and the switch button.

4. **Duration of "New" Label:**
   - Ensure the "New" label is active for only one release cycle.

Ensure all changes follow the existing stylistic and procedural patterns utilized in the repository.
