### Instruction for Programmer:

This Pull Request (PR) focuses on enhancing the **ImageResizer** settings in terms of accessibility, fixing bugs, and refactoring code. Below are the succinct instructions and changes to be aware of:

1. **Accessibility Enhancements:**
   - Assign an accessible name to the image size preset settings card group. Ensure the "Add" button provides context to screen readers.
   - Update the accessible name for the "Add" button from "Add new size" to "Add new preset."
   - Include dynamic Name and FullDescription fields for "Edit" and "Remove" buttons, now referencing the preset name.

2. **Fixes:**
   - Address the issue where fit and unit texts were missing in the card description fields.
   - Refactor converters (`ImageResizerFitToStringConverter` and `ImageResizerUnitToStringConverter`) to create lookups, minimizing repeated resource calls.

3. **Localization Improvements:**
   - Rename "EditButton" to "ImageResizer_EditButton" in resources and XAML.
   - Ensure localized default names for new image size presets are handled in the view model, not in `ImageResizerPage`.

4. **ViewModel Adjustments:**
   - Update public property usages; avoid direct backing field assignments.
   - Modify `SavesImageSizes()` sequence to reflect changes in `sizes.json` accurately.
   - Utilize `Settings.Properties.ImageresizerCustomSize` for initializing new preset properties.
   - Replace repeated if-else with `EncoderGuid` lookup.
   - Centralize `CollectionChanged` event handlingâ€”simplify `SizePropertyChanged()` to call `SaveImageSizes()`.
   - Rename `_advancedSizes` to `_sizes` for consistency.
   - Consolidate property setting logic into `SetProperty()` method.
   - Remove redundant JSON savers in `Encoder` setter and adjust method names for clarity (`AddRow()` to `AddImageSize()`).
   - Clean up `PropertyChanged` event handling when presets are deleted.

5. **ImageSize Refactor:**
   - Eliminate the `Update()` method, relying on dependency properties.
   - Substitute parameterless constructor with constructor defaults.
   - Remove serialization of non-essential fields (`[JsonIgnore]`) and irrelevant ones like `ExtraBoxOpacity`.
   - Correct misspelled fields (`EnableEtraBoxes` to `IsHeightUsed`).

### Validation and Testing:
- Utilize Accessibility Insights for Windows to confirm new values.
- Ensure correct display and persistence of all attributes in JSON files.
- Confirm smooth operation in deletion and addition of presets, validating list order retention.
- Validate custom properties in new preset creation.

By following the above instructions, you will successfully integrate and test all the changes set forth in this PR.
