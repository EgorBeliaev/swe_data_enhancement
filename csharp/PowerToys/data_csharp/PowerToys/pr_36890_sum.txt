Title: [Peek]Fix using the correct Monaco assets at runtime

**Issue:**
After a specific commit (20a5f67222f74c687a08aa4d3bf1ba8c978faf86), there's a problem when running Peek Monaco preview from a release installer, causing a crash in WebView 2. This crash occurs because the `MonacoHelper` class fails to recognize that itâ€™s operating in the `WinUI3Apps` directory.

**Root Cause:**
The issue arises from the replacement of `Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location)` with `AppContext.BaseDirectory` in the offending commit. The `AppContext.BaseDirectory` includes an extra directory separator at the end that disrupts the logic, causing the directory path to be misinterpreted.

**Resolution Steps:**
- Modify the logic to handle `AppContext.BaseDirectory` ensuring that any trailing directory separators are removed in order to accurately derive the current operating directory.
- Verify that `MonacoHelper` correctly identifies the directory, especially distinguishing between `PowerToys/Assets/Monaco` and `PowerToys/WinUI3Apps/Assets/Monaco`.

**Validation:**
- Build a release installer and test Monaco on both the Peek feature and the file preview handler to ensure the solution is effective and resolves the crash issue.
