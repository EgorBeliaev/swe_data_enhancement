**Instructions for Programmer:**

1. Update `CalculateHelper.InputValid()` to:
   - Allow octal numbers.
   - Allow uppercase base notation (e.g., `0X`).

2. Enhance division by zero checks to be aware of binary and octal numbers. Ensure the division by zero in non-decimal bases triggers the appropriate checks.

3. Ensure compatibility with Mages dependency v3.0.0, especially with the new octal number support.

4. Validate changes with the added tests and perform manual testing in PTRun as described.
