### Instruction to Programmer:

1. **Objective**: Fix black top border issue for various windows on Windows 10.
   
2. **Affected Windows**: 
   - Settings Window
   - OOBE Window
   - HOSTS Editor Window
   - Advanced Paste Window
   - Environment Variables Editor Window
   - File Locksmith Window
   - Peek Window
   - Registry Preview Window

3. **Approach**:
   - Implement `DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea()` in addition to `ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar` for windows using WinUI.
   - Modify `Peek` module to use `ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar` directly on `MUX.Window` instead of `AppWindow.TitleBar`.

4. **Additional Notes**:
   - On Windows 11, this implementation is a no-op.
   - `AppWindow.TitleBar` usage issue discussed; consider future-proofing against potential deprecation of `ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar`.
   - Review the naming of `ForceTopBorder1PixelInset()`; consider checking OS within it for no-op on Windows 11.

5. **Validation**:
   - Verify top border appearance for listed windows on Windows 10.
   - Ensure appearance remains unchanged for Windows 11 for at least the Settings and HOSTS Editor windows.

By following this instruction, the black border bug on Windows 10 will be addressed without affecting Windows 11 appearance.
