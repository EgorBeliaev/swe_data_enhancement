This Agreement is effective as of the latest signature date below.\r\n> \r\n> 1. **Definitions**.\r\n>    **\u201cCode\u201d** means the computer software code, whether in human-readable or machine-executable form,\r\n>    that is delivered by You to Microsoft under this Agreement.\r\n>    **\u201cProject\u201d** means any of the projects owned or managed by Microsoft and offered under a license\r\n>    approved by the Open Source Initiative ([www.opensource.org](http://www.opensource.org)).\r\n>    **\u201cSubmit\u201d** is the act of uploading, submitting, transmitting, or distributing code or other content to any\r\n>    Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control\r\n>    systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of\r\n>    discussing and improving that Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or\r\n>    otherwise designated in writing by You as \u201cNot a Submission.\u201d\r\n>    **\u201cSubmission\u201d** means the Code and any other copyrightable material Submitted by You, including any\r\n>    associated comments and documentation.\r\n> 2. **Your Submission**.

You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work.\r\n>    Should You wish to Submit materials that are not Your original work, You may Submit them separately\r\n>    to the Project if You (a) retain all copyright and license information that was in the materials as You\r\n>    received them, (b) in the description accompanying Your Submission, include the phrase \u201cSubmission\r\n>    containing materials of a third party:\u201d followed by the names of the third party and any licenses or other\r\n>    restrictions of which You are aware, and (c) follow any other instructions in the Project\u2019s written\r\n>    guidelines concerning Submissions.\r\n> 4. **Your Employer**. References to \u201cemployer\u201d in this Agreement include Your employer or anyone else\r\n>    for whom You are acting in making Your Submission, e.g. as a contractor, vendor, or agent.
