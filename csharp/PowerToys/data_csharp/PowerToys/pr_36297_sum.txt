### Instruction for Programmer:

1. **Primary Objective**: Resolve AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) build issues in the Advanced Paste module. Implement necessary changes to allow AOT-enabled builds.

2. **Upgrades Needed**:
   - Upgrade `CommunityToolKit.WinUI` to the latest preview version to leverage its native AOT support.
   - Consider using `CommunityToolKit.Mvvm v8.4.0` for enhanced AOT diagnostics, although its direct benefit for native AOT support needs verification.

3. **Compatibility Note**:
   - Be aware that `ReverseMarkdown` does not currently support Native AOT.

4. **Validation**:
   - Ensure all tests are updated and pass after implementing changes.

5. **Pipeline and Documentation**:
   - Update necessary YML files for CI and signed pipelines as per the PR checklist.
   - Ensure new binaries are properly integrated, referencing JSON for signing, WXS for installer, and related localization updates.

6. **Release Consideration**:
   - Hold off on merging this PR until ongoing release tasks are complete, as indicated by the "Don't Merge" tag.
   - The PR is currently marked as "ready to review" once blockers are clarified in future updates.

7. **Spelling and Documentation**:
   - Fix any spelling issues such as the unrecognized word "Kernal".
   - Ensure documentation updates are linked if checked as completed in the PR checklist.

### Issue Amidst Repository:

The current state of the Advanced Paste module prevents successful builds when AOT is enabled, primarily due to the need for upgraded dependencies and unsupported components. This PR aims at resolving these compatibility issues and enhancing build processes with updated tools and dependencies.
