What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\r\n## Summary of the Pull Request\r\n\r\nWhen opening the list of language selection of Quick Accent on Settings, the first load selects all the languages one by one, triggering a save everytime, meaning the saved state might get into a state where some of the languages are missing.\r\nThis PR guards against triggering the \"selctionChanged\" event if all we're doing is the first load.\r\n\r\nIt also adds a check against loading a non existing language and adding a null entry to the loaded array after LINQ.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] **Closes:** https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/36370#issuecomment-2552315616\r\n- [ ] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors already.
