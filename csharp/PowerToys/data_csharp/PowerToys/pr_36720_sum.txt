**Instruction for Changes:**

1. Replace the `WarnIfElevationIsRequired` inline function with the new `NotificationUtil` helper class that utilizes `FileWatcher`.
2. The new helper should cache user options and use `FileWatcher` to monitor changes in the general settings JSON, preventing Always on Top (AOT) and Fancy Zones (FZ) from repeatedly reading this JSON file.
3. Ensure the `WarnIfElevationIsRequired` in Workspaces snapshot tool functions as intended but confirm it is used only once.
4. Verify all notifications function correctly, and monitor that AOT and FZ do not frequently access the general settings JSON as observed in Process Monitor.
5. Address issue #36586 with these changes. 

**Testing:**
- Manually validate that changing the warning setting impacts AOT, FZ, and Workspaces snapshot tool as specified:
  - Notifications should not appear when the warning option is 'Off'.
  - When 'On', notifications should appear, except AOT and FZ should not repeat notifications unnecessarily.
  - Confirm AOT and FZ access general settings JSON only when the setting is changed, verified using Process Monitor.
