Instead of just being \"Edit\" and \"Remove\", the Name properties now also refer to the preset name, e.g. \"Edit the Small preset\". New description fields give a complete summary of all the preset properties, e.g. \"Removes the Large preset, which fits to 1920 by 1080 pixels\".\r\n\r\n### Preset Descriptions fix\r\n- Fixed the fit and unit text being absent in the card description field.\r\n- Refactored `ImageResizerFitToStringConverter` and `ImageResizerUnitToStringConverter` to create lookups instead of querying for the resource on every call.\r\n\r\n### Localization\r\n- Renamed \"EditButton\" to \"ImageResizer_EditButton\" in resources and XAML, to align with other names and to reduce the risk of future conflicts with control IDs on other settings pages.\r\n- ImageResizerPage should not have to know the localized default name for adding a new image size preset. This has been made a default in the view model instead.\r\n\r\n### ViewModel Fixes and Refactor\r\n- Backing fields were directly set to the settings values. The public property names are now used consistently, following best practice.\r\n- `SavesImageSizes()` saved the settings to the \"sizes.json\" file _before_ updating the settings value itself. This may have resulted in issues where adding a new preset, not changing any of its properties, then closing/navigating away would not save the new item in \"sizes.json\", even though it would be correctly saved in \"settings.json\".\r\n- Hard-coded values for new preset properties removed. These are now taken from `Settings.Properties.ImageresizerCustomSize` instead.\r\n- `EncoderGuid` lookup added, replacing repeated if-else code in `GetEncoderGuid()` and `GetEncoderIndex()`.\r\n- Various assignments between the observable `Sizes` property and its backing field or temporary variables have been removed and replaced with a centralised `CollectionChanged` handler. For example, `SizePropertyChanged` was:\r\n\r\n``` csharp\r\n    public void SizePropertyChanged(object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        ImageSize modifiedSize = (ImageSize)sender;\r\n        ObservableCollection<ImageSize> imageSizes = Sizes;\r\n        imageSizes.First(x => x.Id == modifiedSize.Id).Update(modifiedSize);\r\n        _advancedSizes = imageSizes;\r\n        SavesImageSizes(imageSizes);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\t\t\r\nand can now be reduced to:\r\n\t\r\n``` csharp\r\n    public void SizePropertyChanged(object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        SaveImageSizes();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\t\r\n- Renamed the `Sizes` observable collection backing field to `_sizes` from `_advancedSizes`.\r\n- Refactored repeated property setting code into a new `SetProperty()` function.\r\n- Removed saving to \"sizes.json\" in the `Encoder` setter. The encoder guid is not saved in that file. It is still saved in \"settings.json\" in `SetProperty()`.\r\n- Renamed `AddRow()` to more descriptive `AddImageSize()`. This also matches the existing `DeleteImageSize()`.\r\n- Fixed the `PropertyChanged` event handler not being cleaned up when deleting a size preset, in `DeleteImageSize()`. Subscribing and unsubscribing is now handled in new methods `SubscribeToItemPropertyChanged()` and `UnsubscribeFromPropertyChanged()`, keeping this related code together.\r\n- Slightly simplified `GenerateNameForNewSize()`.\r\n\r\n### ImageSize Fixes and Refactor\r\n- `Update()` is not required and has been removed. Dependency properties are correctly defined for the bound fields already.\r\n- Removed parameterless constructor and added constructor parameter defaults instead.\r\n- Refactored repeated property setting code into a `SetProperty()` function.\r\n- Added [JsonIgnore] to fields which were not meant to be serialized.\r\n- Removed unused `ExtraBoxOpacity` field.\r\n- Renamed `EnableEtraBoxes` (sic) to `IsHeightUsed`, better reflecting its usage.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\r\n## Validation Steps Performed\r\n\r\n### AIW Tests\r\nConfirmed new accessibility values were present by using Accessibility Insights for Windows:\r\n\r\n- New group Name and updated add button Name:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2025-01-15 023536](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f7be8b4-5050-4212-9ba2-5c342a9a707e)\r\n\r\n- Edit and Remove buttons include the size preset name in their Name properties:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2025-01-14 000626](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea305303-47c0-4eef-9986-bdeba0ad7597)\r\n\r\n- Edit and Remove buttons include FullDescription accessibility fields with complete summary information on the preset properties:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2025-01-15 023037](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b61c7170-98ee-4e4d-b767-557cd0597567)\r\n\r\n### Other Tests\r\n\r\nTested that:\r\n- The fit and unit descriptions were now correctly displayed with the width and height information.\r\n- All values were updated correctly when the image preset properties were updated, including Name and FullDescription accessibility properties.\r\n- Properties were correctly persisted to both \"sizes.json\" and \"settings.json\" files.\r\n- The old JSON files were correctly read, i.e. the now-ignored properties in ImageSize do not cause any issues.\r\n- Different formats are correctly used for whether the height property is being used in the preset.\r\n- Deleting size presets at the beginning, middle and end of the list do not cause issues and the list is reloaded in the same order when navigating away from the page and back again.\r\n- Adding a new size preset shows the custom width and height, not the same values as the Small preset.\r\n- Adding and editing new sizes correctly persists the properties to \"sizes.json\" and \"settings.json\" files and these are loaded back in the same order when navigating away from and back to the settings page."
