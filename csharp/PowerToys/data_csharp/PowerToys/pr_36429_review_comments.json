What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\r\n## Summary of the Pull Request\r\n\r\nThe top border of windows in Windows 10 will no longer always be black, instead of the appropriate color. Specifically, it fixes the following windows:\r\n\r\n- Settings Window\r\n- OOBE Window\r\n- HOSTS editor window\r\n- Advanced Paste window\r\n- Environment Variables editor window\r\n- File Locksmith window\r\n- Peek window\r\n- Registry Preview window\r\n\r\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] **Closes:** #30001\r\n- [x] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors already. If work hasn't been agreed, this work might be rejected.\r\n- [ ] **Tests:** Added/updated and all pass (No tests added, but it looks like some of the Fancy Zones UI tests are failing to start.)\r\n- [ ] **Localization:** All end user facing strings can be localized (N/A)\r\n- [ ] **Dev docs:** Added/updated (N/A)\r\n- [ ] **New binaries:** Added on the required places (N/A)\r\n   - [ ] [JSON for signing](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/main/.pipelines/ESRPSigning_core.json) for new binaries\r\n   - [ ] [WXS for installer](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/main/installer/PowerToysSetup/Product.wxs) for new binaries and localization folder\r\n   - [ ] [YML for CI pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/main/.pipelines/ci/templates/build-powertoys-steps.yml) for new test projects\r\n   - [ ] [YML for signed pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/main/.pipelines/release.yml)\r\n- [ ] **Documentation updated:** (N/A)\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a more detailed description of the PR, other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->\r\n## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments\r\n\r\nThis adds a bit of extra code to make any window that's using WinUI and `ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar` _also_ call `DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea()` on that window. This does nothing on Windows 11, but on Windows 10, resolves the \"top 1px border is black\" bug, with one caveat.\r\n\r\nThat caveat is visible in my changes to the Peek module: I changed it from using `AppWindow.TitleBar.ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar` to just using the `ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar` property directly on the `MUX.Window`. This is because, for _some reason_, using the `AppWindow.TitleBar`'s version of the property makes `DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea()` suddenly do nothing. No clue why.\r\nThis is not ideal, because it's my understanding that `AppWindow.TitleBar` is The Future(tm), and the old `ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar` is probably going to be deprecated soon. \r\n\r\nOther thoughts:\r\n\r\n- `ForceTopBorder1PixelInset()` is kind of a stupid name. Open to suggestions.\r\n- Should we do an OS check inside `ForceTopBorder1PixelInset()` so it's a no-op on W11?\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\r\n## Validation Steps Performed\r\n\r\nOpened each of:\r\n- Settings Window\r\n- OOBE Window\r\n- HOSTS editor window\r\n- Advanced Paste window\r\n- Environment Variables editor window\r\n- File Locksmith window\r\n- Peek window\r\n- Registry Preview window\r\n\r\n...on Windows 10 and verified that the top borders all showed correctly.\r\n\r\nI also validated (just for the Settings Window and HOSTS editor window) that the appearance on Windows 11 was unchanged.\r\n\r\n"
