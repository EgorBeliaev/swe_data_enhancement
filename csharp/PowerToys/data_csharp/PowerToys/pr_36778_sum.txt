Fix accessibility issues in the Advanced Paste window by:

1. Ensuring paste actions have readable text and Ctrl+Num shortcuts for screen readers.
2. Enabling paste actions to work with keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter, space).
3. Enhancing screen reader interaction for:
   - Clipboard history items, including images.
   - Clipboard history more options button.
   - Thumbs up/down buttons.
4. Adding extra descriptive texts to improve screen reader descriptions in higher verbosity settings.
5. Implementing `PasteFormatTemplateSelector` to indicate disabled items more explicitly.

Ensure changes are tested using Narrator with default settings for functionality verification.
