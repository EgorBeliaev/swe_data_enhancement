If work hasn't been agreed, this work might be rejected\r\n- [x] **Tests:** Added/updated and all pass\r\n- [x] **Localization:** All end user facing strings can be localized\r\n- [x] **Dev docs:** No need\r\n- [x] **New binaries:** None\r\n- [x] **Documentation updated:** No need\r\n## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments\r\nThe Mages dep has been recently upgraded to v3.0.0, introducing support for octal numbers and hence requiring this PR. Therefore it would be great if it got merged in this release cycle, so that there wouldn't be a release with v3.0.0 that doesn't properly support it.\r\n<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->\r\n## Validation Steps Performed\r\nManually tested in PTRun + added tests"
