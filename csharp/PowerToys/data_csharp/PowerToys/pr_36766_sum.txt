**Task: Update Localization Pipeline**

**Issue:**  
In the localization pipeline, when a service failure occurs and a retry is triggered, downloaded localized files are incorrectly included in the resource files due to a regex issue. This results in TDBuild using these files incorrectly.

**Fix Required:**  
- Update the regex to exclude the output folder from the source path to ensure only appropriate files are used during retries.

**Additional Context:**
- Refer to incident: [ICM Incident](https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v5/incidents/details/576641069/summary).
- Validation is required to confirm this fix ensures proper exclusion of downloaded files upon retries.
- Ensure all end-user-facing strings remain localizable and update documentation as necessary.

**Steps for Programmer:**
1. Modify the regex pattern in the localization pipeline to exclude the output folder.
2. Test the updated pipeline to confirm the fix works correctly and passes all tests.
3. Ensure compliance with localization and deployment requirements, as outlined in the PR checklist.

Make sure these modifications align with the existing structure of the repository without introducing new workflow disruptions.
