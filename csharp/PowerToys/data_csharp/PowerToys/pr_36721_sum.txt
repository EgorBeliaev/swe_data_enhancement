### Instructions for Changes:

1. **Guard Against Unnecessary Events:** Modify the Quick Accent settings to ensure the "selectionChanged" event does not trigger during the initial language list load. This prevents saving incomplete language states.

2. **Check for Non-Existing Languages:** Ensure that when loading languages, non-existing languages do not result in a null entry within the loaded languages array after LINQ operations.

3. **Validation Steps:**
   - Perform a test by selecting several languages.
   - Open `quickAccentSettings.json` to ensure the language list is saved correctly.
   - Unload and reload Quick Accent page, then verify the saved language file integrity persists.

### Issue Being Fixed:

The PR addresses the issue of unstable language loading in the Quick Accent feature within settings, which results in the saved state containing missing languages due to the initial load selecting all languages and triggering "selectionChanged" events unnecessarily.
