**Instruction:**

Integrate an `Activate()` call in the codebase to ensure the Peek UI window is brought to the foreground if minimized when the hotkey is toggled on a new file. Validate this functionality: the existing tests pass, and manual validation has been performed. Coordinate with the team for further unit tests if necessary. Check all PR checklist items and handle any required documentation updates.
