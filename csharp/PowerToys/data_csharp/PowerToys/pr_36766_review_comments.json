What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\r\n## Summary of the Pull Request\r\n**Root cause**\r\nThe root cause of  the issue is that during the execution of the localization pipeline, some already localized files were downloaded. However, when the service failed and triggered a retry, the regex used to search for all resource files also included the downloaded files. \r\nthis pipeline caused the issue: https://microsoft.visualstudio.com/Dart/_build/results?buildId=112645818&view=results\r\nThe request failed, as shown in the image below:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35edae82-e71f-4e2b-a963-458498fb125d)\r\nHere, localized files start to be incorrectly used by TDBuild.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c6358bb-d509-4e97-bf06-175271a22a02)\r\n\r\nICM: https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v5/incidents/details/576641069/summary\r\n\r\n**PR fix**\r\nThis fix addresses the issue by excluding the output folder from the source path regex.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] **Closes:** #xxx\r\n- [ ] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors already.
