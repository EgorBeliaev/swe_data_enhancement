**Instruction for Change:**

1. **Modify Guard Helpers**: Utilize `nameof` for `CallerArgumentExpression` in the Guard helper methods to enhance maintainability.

2. **Merge Requirement Checklist**: 
   - Ensure all contributions comply with the [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), focusing on license requirements, nullable enabled settings, and static analysis compliance.
   - Add or update unit tests to cover the changes.
   - Update the appropriate `CHANGELOG.md` files for any non-trivial changes.
   - Review any changes made to the public API, if applicable.

3. **Coverage Report**: 
   - All modified and coverable lines must be covered by tests, as current coverage is confirmed to be 86.48%.

4. **Additional Considerations**: 
   - Note the relation to the contrib repo, specifically in the file `Guard.cs`, which has a copy. Be aware of this linkage when making changes.

This update is part of ongoing efforts to address maintainability issues due to the current configuration where `<AnalysisLevel>latest-All</AnalysisLevel>` is not globally enabled, as mentioned in ongoing discussions in [issue #3958](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/issues/3958#issue-1470316050).
