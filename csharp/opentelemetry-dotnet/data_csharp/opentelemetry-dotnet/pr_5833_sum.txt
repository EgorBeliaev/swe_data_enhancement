**Instruction for the Programmer:**

1. **Objective:** Align nullable annotations and code comments in console and in-memory exporter registration extensions with the existing consistency found in OTLP, Zipkin, and Prometheus exporters.

2. **Modification Details:**
   - Update the method signatures for registration extensions by removing the nullable `?` from `Action<ExporterOptions>? configure` parameter where applicable.
   - Allow `null` as a valid input for the `configure` parameter without promoting its usage.

3. **Reference Update:**
   - Ensure the implementation aligns with discussions and decisions made in the referenced GitHub conversation: [open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib#2067](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib/pull/2067#discussion_r1758241013).

4. **Coverage Details:**
   - Confirm that all coverable lines modified are covered by tests as per the Codecov report.
   - Project coverage has increased from 83.38% to 86.21%.

Focus on ensuring code consistency without altering the functional intent as previously established in related exporter implementations.
