### Instructions for Programmer:

1. **Modification Overview**: Update the serializer logic to support multiple OTLP exporter registrations by modifying static lists to be thread-static. Ensure these changes are implemented at the serializer level.
   
2. **Checklist Requirements**:
   - Follow the [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) including licensing, enabling nullable, and static analysis.
   - Add or update unit tests to cover the new functionality.
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` files appropriately for non-trivial changes.
   - If there are changes in the public API, review these changes thoroughly.

3. **Testing and Coverage**:
   - Ensure all modified lines are covered by tests. Current project coverage is approximately 86.44%. Verify coverage hasn't significantly decreased.
   - Check coverage on specific serializers:
     - `ProtobufOtlpLogSerializer.cs` (currently at 98.49%)
     - `ProtobufOtlpMetricSerializer.cs` (currently at 98.78%)
     - `ProtobufOtlpTraceSerializer.cs` (currently at 95.01%)
   - Address any identified missing lines or flags impacting coverage.

4. **Address Baseline Issues**:
   - Examine specific files/components highlighted by Codecov if coverage shows any regression or significant impacts.

By following these instructions, you will ensure that the PR properly implements the feature to enable multiple OTLP exporter registrations and meets the repositoryâ€™s quality and coverage standards.
