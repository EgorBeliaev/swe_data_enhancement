Remove the redundant `if` condition in `WriteUnicodeNoEscape` method of the Prometheus Exporter. Specifically, remove the `ordinal <= 0xFFFF` check because it is always true due to the preceding `ordinal <= 0x07FF` check. Ensure all [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines are followed, update unit tests as needed, and if there are non-trivial changes, update `CHANGELOG.md`. Additionally, consider adding a comment explaining the boundary conditions for clarity.
