**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Replace Implementation**:
   - Remove the current logs and metrics implementation within `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol`.
   - Introduce the new implementation, renaming it to maintain consistency with existing names.

2. **Package References**:
   - Remove the following packages from the OTLP Exporter project:
     - `Google.Protobuf`
     - `Grpc`
     - `Grpc.Net.Client`
     - `Grpc.Tools`

3. **Remove Proto Files**:
   - Delete all proto files from the project.

4. **Test and Benchmark Updates**:
   - Update tests and benchmarks to include proto files and the following packages:
     - `Google.Protobuf`
     - `Grpc`
     - `Grpc.Tools`
     - `Grpc.Net.Client`
   - Ensure tests reflect the new implementations and pass successfully.

5. **Refactor File Locations**:
   - Consider restructuring the unit tests and benchmarks to store proto files in a common directory, reducing duplication.

6. **Documentation and Changelog**:
   - Update the `CHANGELOG.md` for any non-trivial public-facing changes to ensure all modifications are documented. 

Note: While the merge requirement checklist is partially completed, ensure that all unchecked tasks are addressed before finalizing the merge.
