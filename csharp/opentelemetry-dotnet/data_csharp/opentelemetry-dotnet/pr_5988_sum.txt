   - Implement enhanced exception handling within the method.

2. **Implement Retry Logic:**
   - Add retry logic for handling buffer overruns during batch processing.

3. **Add Missing Signal Path:**
   - Integrate the missing signal path to send logs and metrics to the OTLP endpoint.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Ensure unit tests are added or updated.
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` for significant changes.
   - Review changes to any public API if applicable.

5. **Code Coverage:**
   - Address the patch coverage issue as indicated by Codecov, focusing on the files that have missing lines.

### Coverage Issues:
- Pay attention to the following files with missing test coverage:
  - `OtlpExporterOptionsExtensions.cs`
  - `ProtobufSerializer.cs`
  - `ProtobufOtlpTraceSerializer.cs`
  - Other related Protobuf OTLP exporter classes.
