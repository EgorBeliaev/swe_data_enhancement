This pull request introduces the `ProtobufOtlpTraceExporter`, which will replace the current `OtlpTraceExporter`. Ensure this exporter is marked as internal. No immediate changes to tests are made in this PR to avoid redundant work; however, confirm tests work by manually adjusting them locally.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement similar changes for Logs and Metrics exporters.
2. Replace existing exporters and update tests as necessary.

**Checklist:**
- Ensure all `CONTRIBUTING` guidelines are followed.
- Pending items include:
  - [ ] Adding/updating unit tests.
  - [ ] Updating `CHANGELOG.md`.
  - [ ] Reviewing changes in public API (if applicable).

**Important Note:** Before removing existing implementations, benchmark the current version to compare performance with the new version, ensuring it is faster and more efficient (less/non-allocating).
