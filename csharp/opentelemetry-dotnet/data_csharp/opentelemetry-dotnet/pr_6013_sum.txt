**Instructions for the Repository Updates:**

1. **Expand Array Buffer:**
   - Implement logic to expand the array buffer when a specific limit is reached.
   - Set an upper limit for the array buffer at 2 MB.
   - Add handling to drop any single tag with an array value exceeding 2 MB, updating the value to "TRUNCATED" to aid customer issue identification.

2. **Testing:**
   - Add and update unit tests to verify the increase in base buffer size.

3. **Bug Fixes:**
   - Address a potential `ArgumentException` by reviewing and adjusting the following method calls:
     - `Buffer.BlockCopy(value.Buffer, 0, state.Buffer, state.WritePosition, value.WritePosition);`
     - `Utf8Encoding.GetBytes(value, buffer.AsSpan().Slice(writePosition));`
   - Ensure the buffer is passed by reference where necessary, as it is intended to be doubled in a different method.

4. **Codecov Adjustment:**
   - Note the patch coverage is approximately 89.29% with 3 lines of changes missing coverage.
   - Ensure files with coverage reduction, especially `ProtobufOtlpTagWriter.cs`, are adequately addressed to improve test coverage.

5. **Pending Changelog and API Review:**
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` for non-trivial changes.
   - Ensure any changes to the public API are reviewed.

6. **Merge Checklist Verification:**
   - Ensure all requirements are checked from the contributing guidelines, apart from the unstated ones above.

This PR partially addresses issue #5730, focusing on buffer size management, test enhancements, and bug identification related to buffer handling.
