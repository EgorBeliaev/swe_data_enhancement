**Instruction:**

Update the Zipkin and OTLP implementations to call `HttpClient.SendAsync` instead of `HttpClient.Send` on mobile platforms. This change prevents `PlatformNotSupportedExceptions` that are thrown when `HttpClient.Send` is used on these platforms. Make sure you follow the repository's contributing guidelines, update unit tests as necessary, and ensure that all changes are reflected in `CHANGELOG.md`. Also, review any changes in the public API if applicable.

**Additional Notes:**

- Ensure all modified and coverable lines are covered by tests, maintaining or improving the current coverage level (reported at 86.34%).
- Confirm that the coverage report does not fall behind the main branch, which this change currently matches in terms of coverage.
- Ensure compliance with the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) guidelines as confirmed by automatic checks in the PR discussion comments.
