### Instructions:

1. **Dependency Update**:
   - Introduce a dependency on the `Grpc.Core` package for `net462` and `netstandard2.0` targets.

2. **Code Implementation**:
   - Add a `GrpcExportClient` to handle gRPC requests specifically for `net462` & `netstandard2.0` targets.

3. **Pre-Merge Checklist**:
   - Ensure all unit tests are added or updated as necessary.
   - Make sure relevant `CHANGELOG.md` files are updated for these non-trivial changes.
   - Confirm [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines are checked off, including license requirements and enabling nullable reference types.

4. **Post-Merge Verification**:
   - Review the coverage report, verifying full lines coverage as indicated by the Codecov report while maintaining the project coverability.

This set of modifications aims primarily to address export issues encountered in gRPC implementations within .NET Framework applications.
