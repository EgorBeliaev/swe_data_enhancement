### Instructions for the Programmer:

1. **Refactor Constants:**
   - Move common constants from each signal file into a separate file for better organization.

2. **Cleanup:**
   - Clean up existing constants files.
   - Add a summary with a link to the original proto file in the constants files.

3. **Update Serializers:**
   - Update serializer classes to accommodate the refactoring of constants.

4. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Ensure new unit tests are added and existing tests are updated to cover the changes.
   - Validate that all changes adhere to the project's guidelines as specified in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

5. **Documentation:**
   - Update the `CHANGELOG.md` for any non-trivial changes made to the public API.

6. **Code Coverage:**
   - Address the patch coverage issue (94.29% with 2 lines missing coverage).
   - Review and improve coverage in the files:
     - `ProtobufOtlpMetricSerializer.cs` (Currently 75.00% patch coverage).
     - `ProtobufOtlpTraceSerializer.cs` (Currently 80.00% patch coverage). 

These instructions should guide the programmer to implement the changes effectively and ensure quality by following best practices and maintaining adequate test coverage.
