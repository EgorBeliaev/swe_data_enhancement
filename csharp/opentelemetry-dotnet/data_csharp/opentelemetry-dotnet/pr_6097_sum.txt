**Instruction for Programmer:**

- **Adjust Sampling Logic**: Update the test sampling logic to be compatible with the upcoming .NET 10 behavior, addressing reliance on bugged behavior in current tests. Reference: [Upcoming .NET 10 Bug Fix](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/111289).

- **Improve `ActivityListener` Management**: Modify tests which register `ActivityListener`s so that they clean up properly after themselves to prevent unintended side effects.

- **Verify Coverage**: Ensure all modified and coverable lines are fully covered by tests; the current project coverage remains at 86.40%. No changes needed in code coverage or number of lines/files affected.
