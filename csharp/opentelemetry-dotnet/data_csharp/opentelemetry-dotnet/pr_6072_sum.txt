**Instructions for Programmer:**
1. **Simplify Dispose Code**: 
   - Verify and update the `SelfDiagnostics` code to only use `GC.SuppressFinalize` if the class has a finalizer.
   - Implement the "SuppressFinalize + Finalizer" pattern when there is a need to release unmanaged resources within the class.

2. **Ensure Compliance with Guidelines:**
   - Follow the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines, ensuring license compliance, enabling nullable reference types, and performing static analysis.

3. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Add or update unit tests related to the changes in the dispose code.
   - Update the `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect these non-trivial changes.

4. **Public API Review:**
   - Conduct a review on the changes made to the public API, if applicable.

5. **Coverage Checks:**
   - Ensure that all modified and coverable lines in the code are covered by tests, maintaining the project coverage at the current level.

**Issue being addressed**: This PR simplifies the dispose implementation within the `SelfDiagnostics` module by ensuring that the "SuppressFinalize + Finalizer" pattern is only applied when necessary, adhering to best practices for managing unmanaged resources.
