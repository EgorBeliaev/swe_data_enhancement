Simplify the test class structure in the metrics tests as the additional structure introduced for enabling/disabling delta metricpoint reclaim is no longer necessary. Focus on removing unnecessary classes, and include the `MetricPointReclaimTestsBase` and `MetricOverflowAttributeTestsBase` classes as well. Ensure all unit tests are updated accordingly.
