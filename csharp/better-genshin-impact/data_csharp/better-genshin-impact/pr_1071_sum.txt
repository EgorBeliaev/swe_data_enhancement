**Instructions for Changes:**

1. Update some default parameters associated with the teleportation task in the large map.

2. While determining the nearest teleportation point, also calculate the second nearest teleportation point. Use the distance between these two points to determine the minimum zoom level:
   - If the teleportation task starts with a scale higher than this minimum zoom, force a 'move' action and adjust to the minimum zoom level.
   - Otherwise, proceed with the original 'move' process.

3. Use the zoom level to directly determine the distance the mouse needs to move:
   - Note that `_mapScaleFactor = 2.661` is a provisional value and may have inaccuracies. It was tested under a resolution of 1920x1080 in a borderless mode and may differ on 4K or 2K monitors.
   - Prepare a test version to verify these changes.
