**Instructions for Changes:**

1. Fix the issue of movement failure when passing through open areas while navigating to certain teleport points.
2. Address the problem where teleport points are unclickable during close-range teleportation due to an excessively high initial `zoomLevel`.
3. Implement a restriction on the minimum zoom level to save time when moving the map.

**Note:**
- `zoomLevel` refers to the map's zoom scale, ranging from 1 to 6, where a larger number means a smaller, less detailed map, and a smaller number implies a zoomed-in map.
