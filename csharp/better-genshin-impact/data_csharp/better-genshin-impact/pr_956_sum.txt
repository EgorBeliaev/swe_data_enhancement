**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Key Binding Customization Feature**: 

   - Create a new settings page for key binding configuration.

   - Develop a new control, `KeyBindingTextBox`, which will allow the user to input a single keyboard or mouse key and dynamically update the configuration (Config).

   - Implement functionality to read key binding settings from the Windows Registry and save these settings into `config.json`.

2. **Module Adjustments**: 

   - Modify hard-coded virtual key (VK) values in modules (excluding auto-pickup, auto-fishing, and auto-music modules), except for the Esc and Enter keys which are used for returning to the previous menu and confirming selections.

3. **Code Review & Testing**:

   - Prior to merging, verify if opening the Paimon menu correctly uses global key rebinding. Note: A subsequent test confirmed the Paimon menu cannot be changed.

4. **Known Areas for Future Work** (TODO):

   - Refactor `SettingsContainer` for enhanced configuration retrieval and optimize language configuration checks during startup.

**Issue Being Addressed:**

This PR addresses the inconvenience of fixed key bindings across modules, which becomes problematic with frequent updates and new functionalities in the BGI software, as reported in issues #925, #683, #454, and #862. The new feature aims to facilitate easier, user-customizable key configurations, thereby improving usability and reducing manual intervention post-updates.
