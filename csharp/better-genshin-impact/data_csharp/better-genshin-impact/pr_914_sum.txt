The proposed changes aim to address issues with unintended user interface activations in certain tasks within the repository, specifically related to toggling the "path tracing" feature. The key instructions for implementation based on the PR discussion are:

1. **Remove Configuration Option**: 
   - The task should not be a selectable option but instead be integrated under the `pathing` functionality.

2. **Interface Handling**:
   - Implement detection of the 'X' button in certain interfaces and automate pressing `ESC` to close them if the 'X' button is present.

3. **Adjustments to PathingTask**:
   - Ensure that the script task (`狗粮`/fodder) is properly calling `PathingTask` to maintain functionality without use of simulated inputs, which are to be deprecated.

4. **Testing and Merging**:
   - The implementation will be tested extensively, including the built-in log analysis feature, before final merging and test release.

These concise steps align with suggested improvements or fixes derived directly from the given discussion JSON.
