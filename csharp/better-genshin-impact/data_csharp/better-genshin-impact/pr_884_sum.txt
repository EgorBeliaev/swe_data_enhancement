**Objective:** Implement enhancements and fixes for battle configuration in the repository.

**Key Changes:**
1. **Path Tracing Support**: Add functionality for path tracing in battle configurations.
2. **Auto Battle Check**: Implement a feature to check and adjust color bias at the end of an automatic battle. Note: This is independent of team settings and only applies to standalone missions with auto-battle enabled.
3. **Scheduler Enhancement**: Introduce a "clear" function in the scheduler to reset or clear settings.
4. **Pause Functionality**: Enhance the pause feature to include an "on key press" operation for clearing actions.

These instructions focus on code modifications necessary to support and enhance the battle config functionality as outlined in the PR.
