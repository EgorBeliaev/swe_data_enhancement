**Changes to be Made:**

1. **Modification of Scaling Logic:**
   - Revise the existing scaling logic to ensure it functions correctly.

2. **Mouse Movement Update Post-Scaling:**
   - Update the distance calculation for mouse movement following a scaling operation.
   - Ensure that the movement distance is appropriate and neither too short nor too long post-scaling.

3. **Target Teleport Point Alignment:**
   - Adjust the logic to ensure that after mouse movement, the target teleport point generally aligns near the center of the map.
   - Confirm that this adjustment is functional, as tested with specific anchor points in "奥奇卡纳塔" and "枫丹科学院."

4. **Consultation and Reference:**
   - Reference additional relevant data from issue #318 on the mentioned GitHub repository for further context and alignment.

These changes aim to fix bugs induced by incorrect scaling and improve the precision of target placement post-scaling.
