Title: Reduce the speed of the latter half of mouse movement to avoid inertia, as compensation for the faster front half.

Summary of Changes:
- Adjust the mouse movement speed dynamics. Specifically, decrease the speed in the latter half of the motion to counteract inertia effects while increasing the speed in the first half.

Additional Notes:
- There is an unintended modification to the homepage, which the author did not intentionally make and is unsure how it occurred.

Instructions for the Programmer:
1. Implement the change to adjust the mouse movement speed, focusing on the dynamics of having a slower backend motion and a quicker frontend motion.
2. Investigate and rectify any unintentional changes made to the homepage, ensuring it aligns with the intended state.
