**Instructions for Repository Update:**

1. **Refactoring with BehaviourTree Library:**
   - Implement the BehaviourTree open-source library to restructure the existing auto-fishing functionality.
   - Utilize `FluentBuilderExtensions.Do()` for behaviors but consider larger methods as subclasses of `BaseBehaviour` for better organization.
   - Ensure the refactoring eliminates redundant code associated with the previous implementation.

2. **Post-Refactor Management:**
   - Acknowledge that the code is already operational with the new changes, so ensure it runs without issues before further optimization.

3. **Future Development Branch:**
   - The changes related to this submission will continue to be developed in the new branch: `feat/new_fishing` available at `https://github.com/babalae/better-genshin-impact/tree/feat/new_fishing`.

**Note:** Focus on maintaining code cleanliness and preparing the refactored code for future enhancements.
