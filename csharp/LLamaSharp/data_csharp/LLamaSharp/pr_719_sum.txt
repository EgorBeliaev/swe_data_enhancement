Remove the `Conversation.Prompt(String)` function as it has been marked obsolete. The tokenization process now requires additional parameters that necessitate further consideration. Until templating and tokenization are more advanced, use other tools to tokenize and pass tokens directly to `Conversation`. Reassess the integration of these features at a later stage, once they are more developed.
