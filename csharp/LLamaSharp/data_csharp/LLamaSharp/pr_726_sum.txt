Fix the GPU memory disposing issue in `WithLLamaSharpDefaults` by ensuring the embedding generator has an owner. Replace the `LLamaEmbedder()` constructor with the `LLamaSharpTextEmbeddingGenerator()` constructor to ensure the embedder is disposed properly. Also, ensure model parameters are fully set. Check if `config` can be null, and update nullable annotations accordingly.
