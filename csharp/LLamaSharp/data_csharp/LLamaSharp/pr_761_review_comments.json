        "body": "Added a batch queue to `BatchedExecutor`, allowing an arbitrary amount of work to be queued up in the executor and run in batches. This is helpful when prompting with very large numbers of tokens (e.g. a 2000 character system prompt would automatically be queued up in 4x512 batches).\r\n\r\nThis is a pre-requisite for embeddings prompting (i.e. llava), which needs an entirely new type of item in the batch queue. Embeddings usually also come in large numbers (e.g. one llava image might be hundreds of items), so the ability to queue up lots of work is valuable!"
