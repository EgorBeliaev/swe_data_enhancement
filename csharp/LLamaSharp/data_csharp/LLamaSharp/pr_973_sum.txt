**Instructions for Changes:**

1. Update the `SamplingPipeline` to use `DefaultSamplingPipeline` as the default setting.
2. Remove all deprecated sampler parameters from the codebase.
3. Consider integrating `InferenceParams` directly into `LlamaSharpPromptExecutionSettings` to streamline the API and eliminate duplicate properties such as Temperature.
4. Ensure all properties are correctly translated within `LlamaSharpPromptExecutionSettings` to allow comprehensive settings for users.
5. Modify serialization to accommodate the more complex object structure, potentially using or adapting the existing `LLamaSharpPromptExecutionSettingsConverter`.
