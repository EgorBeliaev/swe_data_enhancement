**PR Title**: Generic Prompt Formatter

**Instructions:**
1. Implement a more generic default template history transformer.
2. Convert EOT and EOS tokens to strings.
3. Apply a minor refactor of `ModelToken` to make it a readonly struct (note: mention of this was struck through, so may not be applicable).
4. Include template convenience methods.
5. Expose metadata access with a get-by-key native handle.
6. Update examples to utilize the updated default history transform and convenience anti-prompt value from the model.
7. Ensure compatibility with .NET Standard 2.0, considering potential issues with removed `using LLamaSharp.Extensions` statements.
8. Consider adding a workflow for compiling against all targeted frameworks to streamline and automate compatibility checks.

Note: The final merge of this PR will depend on successful CI completion.
