**Instructions:**

1. **Image Embedding Enhancements:**

   - Implement new methods for creating image embeddings that do not require context.

2. **Embedding Data Retrieval:**

   - Develop functionality to extract embedding data directly from an image embed, processing one embedding vector at a time.

**Note:** These updates are designed to support embeddings prompting in the `BatchedExecutor`.
