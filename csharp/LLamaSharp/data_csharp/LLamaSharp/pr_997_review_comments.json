This misalignment made the model weight loading fail when a custom logger is used.\r\n\r\n### Help\r\nI am just wondering if it is correct to consider the `CONT` log level as equivalent to `NONE`."

Setting that to `None` will presumably mean that some message using this will be cut in half (because the CONT part will be hidden, due to treating it as None).\r\n\r\nThe best way I can think of to handle this is to have a threadstatic field which stores the last log level used. I'll add a comment inline to show what I mean."
