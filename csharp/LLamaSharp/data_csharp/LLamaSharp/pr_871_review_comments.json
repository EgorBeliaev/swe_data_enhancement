        "body": "- Marked all properties for configuring sampling in `IInferenceParams` as obsolete, pushing to the newer `SamplingPipeline` system.\r\n - Removed old sampling code from `LLamaContext`, instead if no `SamplingPipeline` is supplied one is created (existing one is re-used, as much as possible).\r\n - Updated all examples to use new system.\r\n - Added `AsSpan` to `FixedSizeQueue` to avoid allocations of temporary arrays for every token!\r\n\r\nThe new sampling pipeline system was added a long time ago to address the issues with `IInferenceParams`. Configuring everything with one config object doesn't allow for re-ordering of sampling steps, doesn't allow custom samplers, and allows property combinations which are meaningless. For example using Mirostat sampling ignores almost every other property!\r\n\r\nSee the modified example files to see how the new system is used. In most cases it will simply involve passing a `DefaultSamplingPipeline` object."
