**Instructions for Changes:**

1. Change the default seed for sampling to be randomly initialized with each new sampling pipeline instance, instead of being fixed at 42.

2. Update the following sampling pipeline member names and comments for clarity:
   - Rename `AlphaFrequency` to `FrequencyPenalty`.
   - Rename `AlphaPresence` to `PresencePenalty`.
   - Rename `PenalizeEOS` to `PreventEOS`.
   
3. Note on `PreventEOS`: Ensure that the change completely removes the possibility for `EOS_TOKEN` to be sampled, as it previously caused infinite generation.
