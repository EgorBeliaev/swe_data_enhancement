**Instructions for Repository Update:**

1. **Deprecate `InferenceParams` Properties:**
   - Mark all `IInferenceParams` sampling configuration properties as obsolete.

2. **Transition to `SamplingPipeline` System:**
   - Remove outdated sampling code from `LLamaContext`.
   - Implement a mechanism where a `SamplingPipeline` is created if none is provided, while reusing existing pipelines whenever possible.

3. **Update Examples:**
   - Revise all examples to utilize the new `SamplingPipeline` system.

4. **Implement `AsSpan` in `FixedSizeQueue`:**
   - Add an `AsSpan` method to `FixedSizeQueue` to prevent allocating temporary arrays for each token operation.

**Issue Fixed:**
The transition addresses limitations of the `IInferenceParams`:
   - It resolves the inability to reorder sampling steps.
   - It accommodates custom samplers.
   - It prevents meaningless property combinations, as was the case with Mirostat sampling that ignored most other properties.
