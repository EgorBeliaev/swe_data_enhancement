### Instruction for Implementation:

1. **Reduce Allocations for Sampling:**
   - Implement a method to allow the use of a temporary memory blob for sampling to minimize the number of allocations.
   - Integrate this method within `LLamaContext` and `BaseSamplingPipeline`.

2. **Guidance Method Usage:**
   - Replace the low-level method working directly on logits with the `Guidance` method within the guidance example. Ensure that this method is properly integrated and operational.

3. **Fix `Guidance` Method Bug:**
   - Resolve the issue where the `Guidance` method is passing an incorrectly sized span.

The PR aims to enhance performance by optimizing memory usage during sampling processes.
