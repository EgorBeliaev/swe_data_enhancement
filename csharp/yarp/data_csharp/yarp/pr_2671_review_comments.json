        "body": "This PR has two changes:\r\n\r\n1. Added logic to retry delegation when an ObjectDisposedException happens when delegating\r\n\r\n    #2426 added support to detach from an existing queue when ERROR_OBJECT_NO_LONGER_EXISTS happens due to the owning process detaching from the queue. This works but there exists a race condition where other requests might have already obtained the old handle before we re-initialized and then they get an ObjectDisposedException when trying to use the old handle. Now we retry this error so the request will obtain the new handle and retry the delegation.\r\n\r\n2. Added an ID to the DelegationQueueState (which holds the current handle to the queue) and included that ID in most existing logs.\r\n\r\n    We've seen some odd behavior with IIS and queue management around iisreset. With multiple threads trying to delegate, detach, re-initialize, it's hard to fully follow from logs what exactly is happening. This change uses the current activity's span id as the DelegationQueueState's id. This allows us to track which requests cause queues to be re-initialized/reset. "
