**Instruction:**

Ensure that `HttpVersionPolicy` is always enforced during WebSocket version negotiation in YARP. Specifically, modify the behavior so that if the user specifies `Version=2.0, Policy=RequestVersionOrHigher`, the system attempts to use HTTP/2 WebSockets even if the destination is not using HTTPS. This change must prevent downgrading to HTTP/1.1, ensuring that if HTTP/2 is unavailable and HTTP/1.X usage is prohibited by the policy, the request should fail, highlighting a proxy misconfiguration if the backend only supports HTTP/1.X. Add necessary tests to confirm this enforced behavior.
