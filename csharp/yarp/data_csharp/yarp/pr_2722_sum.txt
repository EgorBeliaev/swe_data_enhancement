**Instruction for Programmer:**

Update the `HttpForwarder` component to throw an exception if a request transformation overrides the `HttpContent`. This addresses potential issues caused by replacing the `HttpContent`, such as incorrect error handling, missing telemetry (`ContentTransferring`), thread-safety concerns, failure to signal client request abortion, and incorrect assumptions in future developments. Consider these implications carefully and ensure the component reacts appropriately by throwing exceptions in such cases instead of silently failing, ensuring robust error reporting.

**Details to Note:**
- Be aware that existing functionalities might break when `HttpContent` is replaced without throwing.
- It can have repercussions on error handling, telemetry emission, and thread safety.
- It is suggested to implement logic that logs an error instead, but maintaining the current behavior of not allowing such overrides is crucial.
