**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Retry Logic Enhancement:**
   - Implement logic to retry delegation in `HttpSysDelegator` when an `ObjectDisposedException` occurs. This is necessary due to a race condition where the process might attempt to use an old handle before re-initialization. This logic ensures the request retries to obtain a new handle.

2. **Logging Improvement:**
   - Introduce an ID (using the current activity's span id) to the `DelegationQueueState` to help identify and track instances of re-initialization/reset events. Ensure that this ID is included in most existing logs to enhance traceability, especially in scenarios involving IIS queue management and `iisreset`.
