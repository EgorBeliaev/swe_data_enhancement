**Instructions for Changes in the Repository:**

1. **PUID/PGID Handling:** 
   - Remove all instances of `appuser:appgroup` usage.
   - Default to using `www-data:www-data` by setting PUID/PGID to 82:82.
   - Provide the ability for users to specify custom PUID/PGID during container startup by dynamically setting IDs.

2. **Dockerfile and startup.sh Modifications:**
   - Update the Dockerfile and `startup.sh` to reflect the exclusive use of `www-data:www-data`.

3. **Package Addition:**
   - Ensure the `shadow` package is added to allow the use of `groupmod` and `usermod` commands for setting user and group IDs.

**Objective:** 
- Ensure the database and logos in the container are consistently owned by the specified user IDs, allowing for flexible permission management.

**Testing Evidence:**
- The changes have been verified through container deployment checks which included verifying database and logo file ownership, ensuring database writability, and logo upload functionality.
