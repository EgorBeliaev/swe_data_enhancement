        "body": "# Background\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/ellite/Wallos/issues/33 there was some work done to support PUID and PGID, however it appears that the use of `www-data:www-data` was left in the Dockerfile and startup.sh file leading to the database and logos being \r\nowned by the wrong user (some things were appuser:appgroup, some where www-data:www-data)\r\n\r\n# What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR gets rid of appuser:appgroup entirely and uses www-data:www-data exclusively by defaulting PUID/PGID to 82:82 (same ID that's being used), and otherwise using the user-defined PUID/PGID by setting the ID on startup.\r\n\r\nThis means that the user id and group id can be freely changed and permissions will float to whatever you specify in the container.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this we need to add the `shadow` package which adds groupmod/usermod commands.\r\n\r\n# How did I test this?\r\n\r\n1. Published a container to ghcr.io/jules2689/wallos:1.0.2 (took a few attempts from 1.0.0!)\r\n2. Changed my deploy to use this container\r\n3. Checked the permissions of the database and logos were the PUID and PGID I set\r\n4. Tried updating an entry in wallos to make sure the database is still writable (as this usually manifests in a read only DB in my experience)\r\n5. Uploaded a logo and made sure it worked\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/ellite/Wallos/issues/617"
