Add support for SMTP settings that allow mail relays without requiring authentication or encryption. Update the application to save SMTP configurations without needing a username or password, and bypass the authentication stage. Additionally, provide an option to disable strict SSL or TLS requirements, making it feasible for use with secure local mail relays that do not require such credentials or encryption.
