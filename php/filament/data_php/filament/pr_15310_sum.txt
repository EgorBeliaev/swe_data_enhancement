**Instruction for Changes:**

Add two new test methods: `assertTableFilterHidden` and `assertTableFilterVisible`. These methods will allow testing if a table filter is visible or hidden, similar to existing methods for table columns.

**Refactor Requirement:**

Refactor `getFilters` and `getFilter` functions to accept a `$withHidden` parameter, enabling the return of all filters irrespective of their visibility state managed by `isVisible()`.

Ensure code style is compliant by running `composer cs`, verify no existing functionality is broken, and keep documentation updated.
