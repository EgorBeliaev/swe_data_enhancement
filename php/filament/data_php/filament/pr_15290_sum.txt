**Instruction for Programmer:**

Implement an enhancement to the `CanDisableOptions` trait by allowing multiple optional conditions for disabling options. Use a structure similar to `HasExtraAttributes` to support these conditions. Integrate additional logic to disable specific locales based on custom conditions, such as when the option value contains 'ai', while maintaining the existing functionality.

Update the code as follows:

- Implement a new method:
  ```PHP
  ->disableOptionWhen(fn(string $value): bool => str($value)->contains('ai'), true)
  ```

Ensure the following actions are completed:
- [x] Run `composer cs` to fix code style.
- [x] Test changes to confirm they do not disrupt existing functionality.
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect these changes (pending).

Note: Seek additional suggestions for alternative solutions if possible before finalizing the documentation.
