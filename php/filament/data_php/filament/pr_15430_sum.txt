### Instructions for the Programmer:
- **Issue Description**: A focus issue occurs when opening a modal from a relation manager. Symptoms include:
  1. Text fields remain selected after clicking away.
  2. Typing continues to update the focused field despite clicking elsewhere.
  3. Buttons and toggles are unresponsive unless double-clicked quickly.
  4. Clicking a bottom button causes unexpected scroll to the selected field.
- **Root Cause**: The issue is caused by `tabindex="0"` on relation managers. When multiple relation managers exist, this conflicts with modal focusing. The conflicts seem to involve livewire or alpine.js focus trap mechanisms.
- **Fix Implemented**: 
  - Remove `tabindex="0"` from relation managers when multiple are present, while ensuring:
    1. Actions and links remain tabbable.
    2. Modal autofocus still applies to the first element.
    3. Focus trapping remains functional.
    4. `->modalAutoFocus(false)` functionality persists.
- **Testing**: Ensure that:
  1. Tabbing to actions and ensuring focus trap works upon modal opening.
  2. Changes do not break existing functionality.
  3. All tested cases are documented and functionality remains expected.

### Issue Association:
