**Instruction for Programmer**:

1. **Issue Being Fixed**: The `RelationshipJoiner` was malfunctioning with specific ordering clauses. It couldn't handle:
   - `->orderByRaw("CASE WHEN role = 'PIC' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END")`
   - `->orderBy(fn (Builder $query) => $query->selectRaw("CASE WHEN role = 'PIC' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END"))`
   
2. **Resolution**: Adjusted `RelationshipJoiner` logic to properly support these ordering methods. 

3. **Testing**: New tests have been added to ensure these use-cases work correctly and prevent potential regressions.

Ensure any edge cases, particularly those involving bindings in raw order clauses, are considered when reviewing the new logic.
