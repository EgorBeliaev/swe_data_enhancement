**Instructions for Implementation:**

1. **Add New Method to ToggleButtons**: Implement the `hiddenButtonLabels()` method in the `ToggleButtons` component to hide the button labels and display only the icons. This replaces the previous `onlyIcons()` method.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Feature**: Completely remove the `optionLabelAsIcon` feature as it is deemed not accessible.

3. **Rename Methods for Consistency**: Ensure the names of the methods align with the standard naming convention. Use `hiddenButtonLabels()` to hide button labels and add a corresponding method `areButtonLabelsHidden()` to check the state.

4. **Test Functionality**: Ensure that the new changes do not break any existing functionality; conduct thorough testing post-implementation.

5. **Update Documentation**: Revise the documentation to reflect the changes, including method renaming and feature removal.

By following these steps, the `ToggleButtons` component will now consistently handle the visibility of button labels within the framework.
