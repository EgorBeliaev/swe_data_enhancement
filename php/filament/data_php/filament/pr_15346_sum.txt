**Instructions for Repository Update:**

1. **Issue Addressed:** 
   - Synchronize the frontend state with actual state. Previous issue: `shouldUpdateRows` was initially set to `false`, blocking the state update process.
   
2. **Behavior Modification:**
   - Modify behavior to ensure proper synchronization between the key-value form component's initial rows and its state.

3. **Validation:**
   - Verify changes to ensure that existing functionality remains intact.
   - Execute `composer cs` to fix code style before finalizing changes.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update documentation to reflect any changes made to the component's functionality.

5. **Visual Reference:**
   - Review the linked video for a demonstration of the resolved issue.

By following these steps, the state synchronization issue in the form component will be resolved, ensuring accurate representation of the state.
