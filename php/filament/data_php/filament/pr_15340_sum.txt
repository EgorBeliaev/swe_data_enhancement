**Instruction for Changes to be Made:**

1. **Editable Column Fix**: Ensure that when table columns are stacked, clicking on an editable column should not trigger the outer `a.href`. Instead, it should initiate the editing of the column value.

2. **Checkbox Adjustment**: Implement `click.stop.prevent` on the wrapping div to prevent triggering `a.href` when `Alpine.isLoading` is `true`.

3. **Input Columns Update**: For text input, toggle, and select columns, simply add `.prevent` to the existing `x-on:click.stop` to prevent undesired behavior.

4. **Code Style**: There is an unresolved issue with code style correction using `composer cs`, as it still incorrectly adds spaces. Address this or note as a pending issue.

5. **Testing**: Confirm that changes do not break existing functionality, as testing has indicated stability thus far.

6. **Documentation**: Ensure that all documentation is up-to-date to reflect these changes.
