**Summary of Changes:**

- **Explicit TailwindCSS Installation**: Update the artisan command `make:filament-theme` to explicitly install `tailwindcss@3`.
- **Compatibility Assurance**: Ensure compatibility with Filament 3 by avoiding potential breaking changes from TailwindCSS version 4.

**Issue Being Addressed:**

The current artisan command `make:filament-theme` installs the latest version of TailwindCSS, which is version 4.0.0. This leads to incompatibilities with Filament 3, as there are breaking changes in TailwindCSS 4's syntax and plugins. Therefore, pinning the TailwindCSS version to 3 will prevent errors during the `npm run build` or `npm run dev` processes.
