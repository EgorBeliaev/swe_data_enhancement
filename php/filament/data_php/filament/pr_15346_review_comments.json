        "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nAs described in https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/issues/13416, there was an issue with the frontend state not reflecting the actual state. This occurred because, during the update process, shouldUpdateRows was initially set to false, preventing the update.\r\n\r\nAfter modifying this behavior, the issue has been resolved, as demonstrated in the following example.\r\n\r\n## Visual changes\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/lKEOCOkdDos\r\n\r\n## Functional changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Code style has been fixed by running the `composer cs` command.\r\n- [x] Changes have been tested to not break existing functionality.\r\n- [x] Documentation is up-to-date.\r\n"
