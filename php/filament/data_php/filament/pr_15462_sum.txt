**Instruction to Programmer:**

Implement a feature that allows widgets to pass additional parameters to the `mount` method on resource list pages effectively. This is necessary to accommodate extra logic and parameters required by some pages to ensure correct widget rendering. Make sure that this new feature does not introduce any new visual changes or break existing functionality. Additionally, ensure that code style conforms by running the `composer cs` command and update documentation to reflect these changes.
