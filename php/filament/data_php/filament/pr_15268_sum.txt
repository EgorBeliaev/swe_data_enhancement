**Instructions for Updates to Table Column Behavior:**

1. **Remove Minimum Width and Padding:**
   - Prevent `min-w-48` and any additional padding from being applied to table columns that are not individually searchable.

2. **Adjust Search Row Height:**
   - Ensure no additional height is added to the search row if all individually searchable columns are hidden.

3. **Code and Documentation Maintenance:**
   - Run `composer cs` to fix code style.
   - Ensure changes are tested and do not break existing functionality.
   - Update documentation to reflect these changes.
