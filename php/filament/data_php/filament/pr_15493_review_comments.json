        "body": "\u2026 works with hidden Steps\r\n\r\nThere was a bug with the action buttons in a wizard. When the last step of a wizard was hidden and then becomes visible, the **submit** button stays visible while it should be replaced by the **next** button.\r\n\r\nThis is due to an issue with `x-show`. Replacing it with `x-bind:class` makes it react to the changes correctly.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the addressed issue or the need for the new or updated functionality. -->\r\nWhen the hidden step became visible, users were unable to proceed to the next step using the action buttons.\r\n\r\n## Functional changes\r\nUpdated the way action buttons are displayed in the Wizard component.\r\n\r\n- [x] Code style has been fixed by running the `composer cs` command.\r\n- [x] Changes have been tested to not break existing functionality.\r\n- [x] Documentation is up-to-date.\r\n"

        "body": "@danharrin \r\nIt looks like an issue with Livewire and Alpine.js 3.\r\nThe `x-show` property is not reactive when used with external components (like those from Livewire).\r\n\r\nI've searched the internet and found others experiencing the same issue. This seems to be the only available fix. So far, neither Alpine nor Livewire have released a solution for this.\r\n\r\nI've already posted this in the Discord server, and another developer confirmed having the same issue: [Discord link](https://discord.com/channels/883083792112300104/1334639581701603482)."
