        "body": "This PR fixes two situations in the `RelationshipJoiner` that did not work:\r\n\r\n- `->orderByRaw(\"CASE WHEN role = 'PIC' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END\")`\r\n- `->orderBy(fn (Builder $query) => $query->selectRaw(\"CASE WHEN role = 'PIC' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END\"))`\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both cases to make the `RelationshipJoiner` handle them correctly. There might always be edge cases regarding this part of the `RelationshipJoiner`, like when the raw order by contains a binding, but at least this makes the joiner handle a few more common cases."
