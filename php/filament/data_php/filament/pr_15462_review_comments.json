In order for widgets to be able to render correctly, some data has to be passed into the mount method params. This makes it possible to implement this logic easily.\r\n\r\n## Visual changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n## Functional changes\r\n\r\n- [X] Code style has been fixed by running the `composer cs` command.\r\n- [X] Changes have been tested to not break existing functionality.\r\n- [X] Documentation is up-to-date.\r\n"
