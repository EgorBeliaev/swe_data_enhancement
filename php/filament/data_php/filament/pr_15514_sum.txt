**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Fix `refreshFormData` Method:**
   - Modify the `refreshFormData` method to correctly update the form data using `form->fill`. This is necessary to resolve issues with the DateTimePicker's value not being updated immediately when using `refreshFormData`.

2. **Apply Fix to ViewRecord:**
   - Ensure that the same fix is applied to the `ViewRecord` functionality for consistent behavior across components.

3. **Code Style and Testing:**
   - Run `composer cs` to verify code style adherence.
   - Test the changes to confirm that they do not disrupt existing functionality and that they solve the reported issues.

4. **Update Documentation:**
   - Ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the changes made and the intended use of the `refreshFormData` with the DateTimePicker and other form components.

**Issue Description:**
The problem arises in the `EditRecord` page where the `refreshFormData` method does not correctly update the `DateTimePicker` field value after certain actions, although the database reflects the changes. The expected behavior is that the `DateTimePicker` field should display the updated value from the model without requiring a page refresh. This issue is linked to GitHub issues #13232 and #14222.
