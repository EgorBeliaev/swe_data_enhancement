**Instructions for Change:**

1. Update the Wizard component to use `x-bind:class` instead of `x-show` for the action buttons.
2. Ensure that the change addresses the issue where the submit button remains visible when the last step of the wizard becomes visible after being hidden, and it should correctly switch to the next button.
3. Run `composer cs` to fix code style issues.
4. Test the changes to ensure existing functionality remains unaffected.
5. Ensure that documentation is up-to-date with the changes.

**Issue Description:**

The current issue in the repository is that within the Wizard component, hidden steps when becoming visible cause a problem where the submit button stays visible. This should instead display the next button. This problem stems from using `x-show`, which is not reactive enough, especially when intertwined with external components like Livewire, and hence needs to be replaced by `x-bind:class`.
