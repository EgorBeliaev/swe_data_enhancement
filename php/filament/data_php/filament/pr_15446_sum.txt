Fix the `TextConstraint` operator in the QueryBuilder for Postgres to correctly handle case sensitivity in table and column names. Specifically, ensure that:

1. When a table name contains uppercase letters, it should be wrapped in double quotes separately from the column name.
   
   - Example: `"Flight".code` instead of `"Flight.code"`.
   
2. When both table and column names contain uppercase letters, both should be individually wrapped in double quotes.

   - Example: `"Flight"."Code"`.
  
Address the issue where the existing implementation incorrectly treats `"Flight.code"` as a single entity resulting in a column not found error.

Ensure the changes do not break existing functionality, and code style is consistent by running `composer cs`. Update documentation as required.
