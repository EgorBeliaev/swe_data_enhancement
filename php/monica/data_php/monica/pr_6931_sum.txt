**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **UpdateContactReminder Service:**
   - Modify the `deleteOldScheduledReminders` method in `UpdateContactReminder.php`:
     - Replace `$this->reminder->userNotificationChannels->each->delete();` with `DB::table('contact_reminder_scheduled')->where('contact_reminder_id', $this->reminder->id)->delete();`.

2. **TelegramWebhookController:**
   - In `TelegramWebhookController.php`, after setting the `active` status of `$channel`, add the scheduling of notifications:
     - Instantiate `ScheduleAllContactRemindersForNotificationChannel` and execute it with the following parameters:
       - `'account_id' => $channel->user->account_id`
       - `'author_id' => $channel->user->id`
       - `'user_notification_channel_id' => $channel->id`

**Summary of the Issue Fixed by the PR:**

- **Primary Bug:** When updating a reminder, associated `user_notification_channels` were inadvertently deleted, causing user settings (e.g., Telegram connection) to be lost.
- **Resolution:** Adjustment of database interaction to prevent unwanted data removal and ensure Telegram setup consistency post-update.
