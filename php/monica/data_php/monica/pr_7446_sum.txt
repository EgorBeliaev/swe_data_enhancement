The PR addresses two issues related to the contact relationship form in the Monica application:

1. **Issue with Retained Form Data**:
   - **Problem**: When a user initially selects the "I know the name" option and enters a name, then switches to "I don't know the name," the entered names persist, causing form submission errors by requesting the user to fill in names.
   - **Solution**: Implement a function to clear form fields related to the "I know the name" option when the "I don't know the name" radio button is selected.

2. **Add Relationship Bug**:
   - **Problem**: Users are unable to add a relationship if they choose "I know the name" followed by "I don't know the name," as the form demands input for the name field despite the change in selection.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that the "I know the name" text box is cleared or hidden when "I don't know the name" is selected, preventing erroneous browser error messages.

These changes resolve form data retention and user interface inconsistencies when toggling between "I know the name" and "I don't know the name" options in the relationship form.
