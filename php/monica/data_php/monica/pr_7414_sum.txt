**Instruction:**  
Add the `ext-intel` PHP extension as a required dependency to ensure that the `Collator` class is available and to prevent the "Collator class not found" issue when working on the project.

**Context:**  
This change addresses the issue reported in [monicahq/monica#7129](https://github.com/monicahq/monica/issues/7129), which involves the absence of the `Collator` class during project development.
