The issue that I opened for these bugs got closed, so I figured I'd try to implement a fix on my own.\r\n\r\nThe combination of these two issues made the experience of using Telegram reminders in Chandler very frustrating.

                    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nUsing the most recent build of Chandler, a pretty major issue occurs when updating a contact reminder which has been scheduled for a notification channel. While going through the update handler, all notification channels which that reminder is using are removed. Note: Not just the `contact_reminder_scheduled` records, but the overall `user_notification_channel` records. This is most definitely not the expected behavior.

I know what you're getting at when you say that, but I think there's a bit of a misunderstanding. When that bit of code runs, it completely wipes out the Telegram connection that I have set up, I need to go back in to the settings and set up Telegram from scratch. It seems that Laravel is not just deleting the record in the pivot table, but actually going one level deeper and deleting that too, if that makes sense?\r\n\r\nThe code was refactored back in September 2022, and I have a hunch it might have been broken since then https://github.com/monicahq/monica/commit/3fa0691453f200e004836326d37bb5f3ec4d2291#diff-5320638e148e1d8cac8cd9f8c6d7b02590b459bf3a8315e95efe882a14ba0225L94-R93\r\n\r\nI've included below the full set of patches I had to make to Monica to get Telegram working.
