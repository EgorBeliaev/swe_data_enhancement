Fix the issue where a company is not properly moved when its associated contact is moved to a different vault. Implement the following changes:

1. When a contact is moved to a new vault:
   - If the company has only this contact, move the company to the new vault.
   - If the company has more than this contact, create a new company with the same information in the new vault.

Ensure these changes address the problem described: when a contact is moved to a different vault, the enterprise is incorrectly still referenced in the original vault and not present in the new vault. After moving, the enterprise details should be correctly listed in the enterprise tab of the new vault.
