**Instruction for Programmer:**

Implement a fix for the issue where the 'can_be_deleted' property in the ContactInformationType object is null upon creation due to missing default database column data. Ensure that after creating a new ContactInformationType, the instance refreshes to re-retrieve complete data from the database, allowing for proper deletion functionality without needing to refresh the page manually.
