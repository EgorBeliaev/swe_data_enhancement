Create 2 vaults (A and B)\r\n2. Create a contact Alice on vault A. Set enterprise details\r\n3. Ensure enterprise tab list the contact, and you can click it from here (you will be redirect to contact of vault A)\r\n4. Move contact Alice to vault B.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nEnterprise tab should be updated in vault B to list enterprise details of contact Alice\r\n\r\nRight now, the vault A (tab enterprise) still list the user and enterprise, and when I click on it, I'm redirect to contact Alice in vault B.\r\n\r\nAlice does not exist anymore on vault A, moving contact is ok.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nbeta.monicahq.com (v5 a.k.a chandler version or main branch)\r\n\r\n### Version of Monica\r\n\r\n89b9f65\r\n\r\n### Installation method\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Web server\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Database engine version\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nHello, I am currently evaluating the Chandler version on the hosted version until a migration is proposed to migrate my self-hosted instance, thanks for the work you put in Monica & Chandler ! Here is a bug I've faced while messing around with some fake data, I'm not sure if this is indented, but this does not seems right ?\r\n",
