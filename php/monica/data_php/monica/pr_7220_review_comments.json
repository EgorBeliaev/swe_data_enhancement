When listing contacts in version 4.x\r\n2. All displayed contacts are uptated\r\n3. Typical request executed in DB:\r\n15163 Prepare\tupdate `contacts` set `uuid` = ?, `contacts`.`updated_at` = ? where `id` = ?\r\n\t\t 15163 Execute\tupdate `contacts` set `uuid` = '2917ce9d-2830-44cc-9548-7e9dfadb3929', `contacts`.`updated_at` = '2023-12-15 08:47:40' where `id` = 1\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAt list, no modification has been done into the contact. I should expect no update.\r\n\r\nBesides, this slows down list drastically!\n\n### Environment\n\nYour own self-hosted instance (monica v4)\n\n### Version of Monica\n\n4.0.0\n\n### Installation method\n\nDocker image\n\n### Web server\n\nNginx\n\n### Database engine version\n\nMariaDB\n\n### Additional info\n\n_No response_",
