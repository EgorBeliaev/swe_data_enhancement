### Instruction for Programmer:

1. **Bug Fix Implementation**:
   - Ensure that the `updated_at` date for contacts is not altered unintentionally when listing contacts.
   - Verify that no database updates occur to the `updated_at` field for contacts during the listing operation in version 4.x.

2. **Test Case Validation**:
   - Reproduce the issue by listing contacts and confirm that there are no updates to the `updated_at` fields.
   - Ensure the fix addresses the performance issue caused by unnecessary updates, thereby reducing the listing time.

3. **Code Review and Merge**:
   - Check the resolved issue aligns with the expected behavior where listing contacts does not modify any contact fields.
   - Review the changes and ensure all committers have signed the CLA (Confirmed by CLAassistant).
  
4. **Release Confirmation**:
   - Ensure the fix is included in version 4.1.2, as noted by github-actions.
   - Validate that the changes are part of the documented release on [GitHub release v4.1.2](https://github.com/monicahq/monica/releases/tag/v4.1.2).
