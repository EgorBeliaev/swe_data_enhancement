**Instruction for Improvement:**

Optimize the event dispatcher by converting the provided mixed-type array of plugins (objects or strings) into an associative array using the plugin name as the index. This optimization reduces calls to `getPluginName` and `getLoadedPlugin`, enhancing efficiency, particularly in large instances with numerous sites or visits.
