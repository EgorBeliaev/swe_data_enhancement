        "body": "### Description:\r\n\r\nDuring an investigation I came across the fact that often after manually resizing the window, the sticky headers of reports do not work correctly anymore.\r\n\r\nThe problem for this lays in the way how sticky headers work for our table reports.\r\nFor tables that would be wider than the available screen, Matomo set `overflow-x: scroll` for the element around the table.\r\nThis should ensure that the table element can be scrolled around.\r\nBut this detection is a bit lagy. It tries to compare the available width with the total width the table would have. This works perfectly in most cases. But when the resize event is triggered, it seems that those elements might not yet be fully re-renderd, causing an incorrect width to be returned.\r\nThis then causes the overflow to be set, which disables the sticky headers. As that mechanism only did set the overflow, but never removed it again - even if the width matched again, resizing easily killed the sticky headers.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a this changes to fix that incorrect behavior:\r\n* Remove `overflow-x: scroll` again, if the width matches\r\n* Add another check 500ms after resize to revalidate if the width then matches again\r\n\r\nrefs DEV-18738\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#functional-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Potential edge cases thought about](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#potential-edge-cases-thought-about) (behavior of the code with strange input, with strange internal state or possible interactions with other Matomo subsystems)\r\n* [ ] [Usability review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#usability-review-done) (is anything maybe unclear or think about anything that would cause people to reach out to support)\r\n* [ ] [Security review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/security-in-piwik#checklist)\r\n* [ ] [Wording review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#translations-wording-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Code review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#code-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Tests were added if useful/possible](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#tests-were-added-if-usefulpossible)\r\n* [ ] [Reviewed for breaking changes](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#reviewed-for-breaking-changes)\r\n* [ ] [Developer changelog updated if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#developer-changelog-updated-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] [Documentation added if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#documentation-added-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] Existing documentation updated if needed\r\n"
