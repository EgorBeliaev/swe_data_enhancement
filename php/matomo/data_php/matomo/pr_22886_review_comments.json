        "body": "### Description:\r\n\r\nIn the current All Websites Dashboard (AWD), the `revenue` information is always shown, unless the `Goals` plugin is disabled.\r\n\r\nFor the redesigned AWD, this condition will be changed to only display `revenue` information if:\r\n\r\n- the `Goals` plugin is enabled\r\n- and\r\n  - at least one website is an ecommerce website\r\n  - or at least one goal has a non-zero default revenue\r\n  - or at least one goal is flagged with \"use event value as revenue\"\r\n\r\nThis check is done on a per-user basis, a user needs at least view access to any site that would quality for displaying revenue information.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe API `Goals.getGoals` was fixed to properly return goals for multiple sites. The goal list was indexed by `idgoal`, but that value is not unique across sites, so if two sites had `idgoal = 1`, you would only get one result instead of two. The API was changed to NOT index the return list with any defined keys to work around this limitation. Requesting goals for a single site will still return them indexed by `idgoal`.\r\n\r\nFetching 40k goals across 10k sites took a varying time between 500ms and 1250ms in my development environment according to XHProf (around 50% of the total runtime), with most of the time spent in `Goals\\API::formatGoal()`. The API will not be called if there is at least one ecommerce site available.\r\n\r\nWithout XHProf active, the response times were always hovering between 175ms and 200ms locally (according to `curl`), and around 75ms to 100ms without any of the new checks.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, we can add an (internal?) `Goals.hasAtLeastOneGoalWithRevenue($idSites)` that could take care of that check in a single database query and circumvent the goal formatting. We can also take this approach if the change to `Goals.getGoals` qualifies as a breaking change and can not be done in a feature release, even though it is also a fix.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes #5045\r\nRefs DEV-15665\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#functional-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Potential edge cases thought about](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#potential-edge-cases-thought-about) (behavior of the code with strange input, with strange internal state or possible interactions with other Matomo subsystems)\r\n* [ ] [Usability review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#usability-review-done) (is anything maybe unclear or think about anything that would cause people to reach out to support)\r\n* [ ] [Security review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/security-in-piwik#checklist)\r\n* [ ] [Wording review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#translations-wording-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Code review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#code-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Tests were added if useful/possible](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#tests-were-added-if-usefulpossible)\r\n* [ ] [Reviewed for breaking changes](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#reviewed-for-breaking-changes)\r\n* [ ] [Developer changelog updated if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#developer-changelog-updated-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] [Documentation added if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#documentation-added-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] Existing documentation updated if needed\r\n"
