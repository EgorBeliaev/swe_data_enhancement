### Instruction to Programmer:

Implement a new privacy setting that randomizes the configuration ID on the backend for every action and visit when the user selects "Anonymize data" under Settings / Privacy. Ensure that each visit is treated as a new, anonymous visit with no access to previous visit data. Follow these steps for integration and verification:

1. **Functional Review**:
   - Confirm the randomization process works as expected without retaining any previous visit identifiers.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider potential edge scenarios, such as unusual input, unexpected internal states, or interactions with other Matomo subsystems.

3. **Usability**:
   - Ensure the new feature is easy to understand and avoids creating confusion that might lead to support queries.

4. **Security**:
   - Conduct a security review to ensure no loophole is created by this change that could compromise user anonymity.

5. **Code Review**:
   - Submit the code for a thorough review to ensure quality and adherence to coding standards.

6. **Testing**:
   - Add tests if possible/necessary to cover the added functionality.

7. **Breaking Changes**:
   - Ensure the change does not introduce breaking changes.

8. **Documentation**:
   - Update or add documentation to reflect the new feature if necessary.

9. **Changelog**:
   - Update the developer changelog to include details of this change if needed.

Ensure a second approval is secured, preferably from someone who has not previously reviewed the changes.
