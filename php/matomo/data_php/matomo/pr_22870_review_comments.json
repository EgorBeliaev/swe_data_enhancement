The `fuzzyMatch` method should perhaps ignore characters that cannot be transliterated or errors should be silenced.\n\n### How can this be reproduced?\n\nUnknown, though the user in question is using the default DB-IP databases, and geolocation appears to be working (there is data in the Locations reports).\n\n### Matomo version\n\n5.1.0\n\n### PHP version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Server operating system\n\n_No response_\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Computer operating system\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Validations\n\n- [X] Read our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/blob/5.x-dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n- [X] Follow our [Security Policy](https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/blob/5.x-dev/SECURITY.md).\n- [X] Check that there isn't already an issue that reports the same bug to avoid creating duplicates.\n- [X] The provided steps to reproduce is a [minimal reproducible](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of the Bug.",
