The pull request addresses an issue in the user interface where the remove icon was incorrectly displayed next to users invited by admin users, regardless of the users' status. The fix ensures that the remove icon is shown only for pending users invited by the admin, aligning the UI behavior with the existing correct behavior in the API, which prevents removing already active users and avoids resultant errors.
