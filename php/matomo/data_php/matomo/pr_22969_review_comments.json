Additionaly some other reserved characters like `<>` are now being removed from both report exports and scheduled report email attachment filenames.\r\n\r\nRefs DEV-18832\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#functional-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Potential edge cases thought about](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#potential-edge-cases-thought-about) (behavior of the code with strange input, with strange internal state or possible interactions with other Matomo subsystems)\r\n* [ ] [Usability review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#usability-review-done) (is anything maybe unclear or think about anything that would cause people to reach out to support)\r\n* [ ] [Security review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/security-in-piwik#checklist)\r\n* [ ] [Wording review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#translations-wording-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Code review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#code-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Tests were added if useful/possible](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#tests-were-added-if-usefulpossible)\r\n* [ ] [Reviewed for breaking changes](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#reviewed-for-breaking-changes)\r\n* [ ] [Developer changelog updated if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#developer-changelog-updated-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] [Documentation added if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#documentation-added-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] Existing documentation updated if needed\r\n"
