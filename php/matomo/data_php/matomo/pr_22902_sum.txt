Fix the untranslated "Ok" button text in the privacy settings dialog for unsaved data deletion settings. Implement translation for the confirm button displaying "{{ TRANSLATE('GENERAL_OK') }}" when changes are detected, ensuring it appears correctly translated. The issue arises when a user changes the "Regularly delete old raw data" setting without saving and then clicks "Purge DB Now," triggering an untranslated dialog. Ensure the button text appears in the user's chosen language. Once addressed, verify the UI reflects the translation accurately.
