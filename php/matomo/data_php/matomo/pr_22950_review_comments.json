Pass search click to underlying <a> tag to make the whole click target work correctly to resolve an issue where clicking the icon focused the input field but the whole click target (grey on hover) didn't if clicked outside of the icon.\r\n2. Adjust data table padding and position when comparing vertical bars as this forces horizontal scroll which cuts off table controls.\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#functional-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Potential edge cases thought about](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#potential-edge-cases-thought-about) (behavior of the code with strange input, with strange internal state or possible interactions with other Matomo subsystems)\r\n* [ ] [Usability review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#usability-review-done) (is anything maybe unclear or think about anything that would cause people to reach out to support)\r\n* [ ] [Security review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/security-in-piwik#checklist)\r\n* [ ] [Wording review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#translations-wording-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Code review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#code-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Tests were added if useful/possible](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#tests-were-added-if-usefulpossible)\r\n* [ ] [Reviewed for breaking changes](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#reviewed-for-breaking-changes)\r\n* [ ] [Developer changelog updated if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#developer-changelog-updated-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] [Documentation added if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#documentation-added-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] Existing documentation updated if needed\r\n"
