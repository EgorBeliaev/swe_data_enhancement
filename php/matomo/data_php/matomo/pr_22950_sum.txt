### Instructions for Resolving UI Issues in the Data Table

1. **Search Click Functionality**: Modify the interaction for the search click through the underlying `<a>` tag. This action ensures that clicking on any part of the target area will correctly initiate the intended function, addressing the issue where the input field was being focused when clicking the icon but not the entire target area.

2. **Data Table Layout Adjustment**: Alter the padding and position of the data table when vertical bars are compared. This adjustment is necessary to prevent horizontal scrolling that results in the table controls being cut off.

These changes are aimed at enhancing the user experience by improving interactivity and maintaining the layout integrity of the data table under specific conditions.
