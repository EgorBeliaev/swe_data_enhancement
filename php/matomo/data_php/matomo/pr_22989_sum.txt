The JSON describes a Pull Request (PR) that addresses improvements and fixes to the `core:invalidate-report-data` command in a repository. Here's a condensed summary of the changes to be implemented:

### Instruction to Implement Changes:
1. **Invalidation of 'All Visits' Segment Only**:
   - Introduce an option to invalidate only the 'All Visits' segment by allowing `--segment=""`.
   - Ensure that when this option is specified, no other segments are invalidated unless explicitly mentioned.

2. **Invalidate All Known Segments by Default**:
   - Modify the logic so that when no segment is provided, all known segments are invalidated, not just those with existing archives.

3. **Correct Range Invalidation for Plugin Archives**:
   - Ensure correct invalidation of range archives when a plugin is specified, similar to "normal" periods.
   - Prevent unnecessary re-archiving of 'All Visits' if not required.

4. **Improved Segment Handling for Multiple Sites**:
   - Adjust the command to ignore segments that don't exist for the provided sites rather than failing.
   - Invalidate segments only for sites where they are present.

5. **Code Restructuring and Testing**:
   - Restructure and enhance the codebase for better performance and reliability.
   - Add comprehensive tests to ensure correct invalidations when different parameters are provided.

Note: The PR author suggests considering further tests for the `Model::updateArchiveAsInvalidated` method at a later time, particularly related to the handling of existing archives and plugin/segment invalidations.

This PR fixes an issue where all segments were invalidated when using the command, adding unnecessary load to the database.
