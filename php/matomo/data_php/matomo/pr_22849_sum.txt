This PR addresses the issue where segment names in a dropdown were truncated, making it difficult for users to navigate the list. Below are the specific changes to be implemented:

1. **Dropdown Responsiveness:**
   - For screen widths above 600px, set the dropdown's minimum width to 240px and maximum width to 320px.
   - Allow the dropdown width to dynamically adjust to match the longest segment name within these constraints.

2. **Dropdown Behavior for Small Screens:**
   - For screen widths below 600px, fix the dropdown width to match the width of its parent button.

3. **PR Fixes:**
   - This PR is intended to fix issue #21291, which is related to improving the usability of segment name visibility within the dropdown menu.

Ensure all the necessary reviews, including functional, usability, security, wording, and code reviews, are completed. Add tests and update documentation as needed.
