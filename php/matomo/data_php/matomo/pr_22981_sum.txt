### Instruction to Programmer:

1. **Update Invalidation Table:**
   - Introduce new columns: `processing_host` and `process_id`.
   - Ensure these fields are populated with the hostname and current process id when an invalidation is marked as "started."

2. **Reset Columns on Release:**
   - Implement logic to reset `processing_host` and `process_id` when an invalidation is released.

3. **Ensure Single Process Handling:**
   - Confirm that only one process handles an invalidation at a time to prevent data overwrites.

4. **Commit Review:**
   - Review the additional commit ensuring cleanup/reset of values in `processing_host` and `process_id` upon release of an invalidation.

5. **Review Dependencies:**
   - Ensure this change does not introduce regressions or dependencies leading to potential issues, as per discussion.

These changes are intended to aid in monitoring, debugging, and recovery during the archiving process in a multi-tenant environment.
