**Issue Description:**

The PR addresses a concurrency bug in the Website Selector feature. When a user views a report available for the current site but not for another, switching sites triggers a `matomoPageChange` event. This event aborts ongoing Ajax calls, including those for the SiteSelector. The fix involves removing the SiteSelector Ajax call from the `GlobalAjaxQueue` to prevent it from being aborted when switching reports. This change ensures the SiteSelector functions correctly without any side effects from abort events.

**Actionable Instructions for Programmer:**

1. **Exclude SiteSelector Ajax Call:** Ensure the SiteSelector Ajax call is not included in the `GlobalAjaxQueue` to prevent it from being aborted by `matomoPageChange` events.

2. **Verify Edge Cases and Interactions:** Consider edge cases, particularly the behavior of code with unusual inputs or internal states and interactions with other Matomo subsystems.

3. **Review and Update Documentation:** 
   - Conduct functional, usability, security, wording, and code reviews.
   - Add tests if feasible and review for any potential breaking changes.
   - Update the developer changelog and documentation as necessary to reflect changes made.
   - Review and update existing documentation if required.
