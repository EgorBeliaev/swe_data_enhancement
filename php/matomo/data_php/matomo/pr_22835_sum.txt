The primary objective of this Pull Request (PR) is to address an issue with the process list lookup in Matomo, which currently depends on the client's terminal width. The proposed change involves modifying the `ps` command invocation to be terminal width independent. This modification aims to reduce the risk of overlapping periods being archived on the same host until a more permanent solution is available via a future change (PR #22487).

Key Instructions:
1. Modify the current `ps` command to use a width-independent invocation. This might involve utilizing the option `w` twice in the `ps` command, as detailed: `ps ww`, to ensure unlimited width for the output.
2. Ensure that this fix is part of the final Matomo 5.2.0 release by integrating it into the `next_release` branch.
3. Conduct thorough reviews: functional, usability, security, and code.
4. Review for potential edge cases and consider interactions with other Matomo subsystems.
5. Add or update tests, developer changelog, and documentation as needed.

References:
- The fix is temporary until PR #22487 is merged.
- The change is also applied to the `next_release` branch to be included in version 5.2.0 without requiring an additional release candidate.
