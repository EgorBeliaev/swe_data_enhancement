        "body": "### Description:\r\n\r\nCurrently it can happen that two concurrent requests may try to update the permission of the same user.\r\nDepending on how the requests are processed this can end up in a more or less undefined state, where some permissions or capabilities from any requests might be set or not.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that requests cannot mess up results of each other this PR introduces the use of a concurrency lock for all API methods that change user permission. This has the effect that each request will be processed completely before another request may try to perform its changes. This ensures that after processing a certain request the resulting state is as expected. Even though it might be changed by another request again straight after.\r\n\r\nreplaces #22957 and #22931\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#functional-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Potential edge cases thought about](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#potential-edge-cases-thought-about) (behavior of the code with strange input, with strange internal state or possible interactions with other Matomo subsystems)\r\n* [ ] [Usability review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#usability-review-done) (is anything maybe unclear or think about anything that would cause people to reach out to support)\r\n* [ ] [Security review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/security-in-piwik#checklist)\r\n* [ ] [Wording review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#translations-wording-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Code review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#code-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Tests were added if useful/possible](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#tests-were-added-if-usefulpossible)\r\n* [ ] [Reviewed for breaking changes](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#reviewed-for-breaking-changes)\r\n* [ ] [Developer changelog updated if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#developer-changelog-updated-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] [Documentation added if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#documentation-added-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] Existing documentation updated if needed\r\n"
