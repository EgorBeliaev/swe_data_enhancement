        "body": "### Description:\r\n\r\nWhen an array setting was empty, it didn't get sent to the API for processing. We are using a custom empty value to signal that and the API to handle that here.\r\n\r\nFor Matomo 6 we may consider using json_encoded array instead though that would be a breaking change for now.\r\n\r\nYou can check that the integration test fails without the JS and PHP changes, and the original issue can also be reproduced by trying to unselect and save all the browsers in the ExampleSettingsPlugin.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/issues/22877\r\nRef. DEV-18796\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#functional-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Potential edge cases thought about](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#potential-edge-cases-thought-about) (behavior of the code with strange input, with strange internal state or possible interactions with other Matomo subsystems)\r\n* [ ] [Usability review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#usability-review-done) (is anything maybe unclear or think about anything that would cause people to reach out to support)\r\n* [ ] [Security review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/security-in-piwik#checklist)\r\n* [ ] [Wording review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#translations-wording-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Code review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#code-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Tests were added if useful/possible](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#tests-were-added-if-usefulpossible)\r\n* [ ] [Reviewed for breaking changes](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#reviewed-for-breaking-changes)\r\n* [ ] [Developer changelog updated if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#developer-changelog-updated-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] [Documentation added if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#documentation-added-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] Existing documentation updated if needed\r\n"
