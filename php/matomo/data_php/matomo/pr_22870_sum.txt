The PR addresses a bug in the Matomo repository involving the `iconv()` function that raises a "Notice" when it encounters illegal characters in strings. The issue is exemplified by the inability to correctly transliterate certain characters (such as those in the string 'Debubawi K’eyyĭḥ Baḥri') from UTF-8 to ASCII. The proposed fix replaces the `iconv()` function with the `Intl` extension to avoid these notices and achieve the expected transliteration output. This change resolves bug #22321 mentioned in the description. 

To the programmer:

1. **Replace `iconv()` Usage:** Alter code to use the `Intl` extension for string transliteration instead of `iconv()` to prevent illegal character notices.
2. **Ensure Functional Compatibility:** Ensure that the functional behavior remains consistent, particularly in PHP GeoIP LocationProvider's `fuzzyMatch` method.
3. **Update Documentation:** If necessary, update relevant documentation to specify the change in the underlying library used for transliteration.
4. **Test the Change:** Validate that after the changes, no illegal character notices are raised, especially in scenarios similar to those previously causing the issue.
