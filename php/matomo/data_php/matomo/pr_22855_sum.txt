**Change Summary for Programmer:**

Implement a mechanism to discard unexpected translation keys on the client-side that do not contain an underscore (`_`). Trigger a more informative warning instead of the current generic warning to aid plugin developers in diagnosing issues. The goal is to enhance the clarity and usability of warnings related to translation keys in Matomo.
