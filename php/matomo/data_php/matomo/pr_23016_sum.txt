The issue addressed by this PR is a false-positive malware detection by Imunify360/ImunifyAV scanners on the `tracker_simpleImageTracker.php` file. The detection is triggered because the file combines PHP statements with HTML starting tags, which scanners may mistakenly identify as a pattern used in malware infections (inserting malicious code before `<html>` in PHP files).

**Instructions for the Programmer:**

1. Implement the `nowdoc`-syntax for echoing output in the PHP file instead of interleaving PHP code with HTML. This should ameliorate potential false positives in malware scanners like Imunify360.
2. Ensure all output in the script uses the PHP `echo` function.
3. Test the modified file to ensure it no longer triggers false-positive detections by Imunify360/ImunifyAV.
4. This change addresses the issue reported in GitHub issue #23011 and should be tested for any potential side effects or unexpected behavior.
5. Update the developer changelog and documentation if necessary after making the changes.

Remember that the aim is to alter the example file format to avoid mistaken malware identification, which would lead to auto-deletion of the file content by certain security tools.
