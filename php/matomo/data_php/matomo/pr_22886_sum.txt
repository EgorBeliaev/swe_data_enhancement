Redefine the display conditions for `revenue` information on the All Websites Dashboard (AWD). Update conditions to display revenue only when the `Goals` plugin is enabled and if at least one website qualifies as an ecommerce site, or if a goal has a non-zero default revenue, or if a goal is flagged to use event value as revenue. Ensure these checks are conducted per-user based on their view access.

Update `Goals.getGoals` API to correctly return goals across multiple sites, ensuring the return list is not indexed by `idgoal` due to their non-uniqueness across sites. Maintain single-site requests indexed by `idgoal`.

Consider adding `Goals.hasAtLeastOneGoalWithRevenue($idSites)` for efficient checks via a single database query, as a workaround for potential breaking change implications in a feature release.

This update addresses issue #5045. Ensure all relevant reviews, edge case considerations, usability, security checks, code reviews, and updates to documentation and changelogs are completed as outlined in the review checklist. Tests should be added where necessary.
