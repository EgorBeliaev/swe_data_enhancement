**Issue Description:**

The sticky headers in reports break after manually resizing the window because of incorrect width detection. When resizing, `overflow-x: scroll` is set, which disables the sticky headers since the rendering is incomplete, thus returning an inaccurate width.

**Instructions to Programmer:**

1. Update the table's interactivity to remove `overflow-x: scroll` once the table width matches the screen width post-resize.
2. Implement an additional validation that checks the width 500ms after the resize event to ensure headers remain sticky if the width recalibrates correctly.

These changes aim to maintain the sticky header functionality during and after window resizing.
