**Issue Summary:**

The pull request addresses a bug where empty array settings were not being sent to the API for processing. A custom empty value is now used to signal empty settings to the API. An integration test can demonstrate the issue by attempting to unselect and save all browsers in the `ExampleSettingsPlugin`. This fix should be considered for Matomo 6, although using a JSON-encoded array might be ideal, it could be a breaking change.

**Instruction for Change:**

1. Update the code to ensure empty array settings are sent to the API with a custom empty value indicating that the setting is empty.

**Additional Notes:**

- Ensure this change is targeted at the `5.2.x-dev` branch.
- Update the developer changelog and existing documentation if necessary.
- Review the potential for breaking changes and edge cases, particularly focusing on the behavior with unusual input or internal states.
- Add tests if useful, or indicate where existing tests validate the fix.
- Verify that all checks including functional, usability, security, wording, and code reviews are satisfactorily completed before merging.
