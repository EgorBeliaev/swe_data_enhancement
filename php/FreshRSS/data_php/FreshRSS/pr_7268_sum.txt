**Instruction for Changes:**

1. **Update Close Button:**
   - Replace `<a href="">` with `<button>` for semantic accuracy.
   - Add ARIA attributes to improve accessibility.
   - Include a `title="close"` attribute on the button for clarity.

2. **Visual Feedback Enhancement:**
   - Implement background color change on mouse hover over the close button for feedback across all themes.

3. **Manual Testing Instructions:**
   - Green notification: Click save on a config page to view `ok/good` notification.
   - Red notification: Remove `required` attribute from the username field under "manage users", then click save to view `bad` notification.
   - Verify hover effect: Ensure the close button displays the "close" title and provides a background color change when hovered.

**Issue Addressed:**
This PR enhances the notification banner's close button for better semantic structure and accessibility, while providing visual feedback through mouse-over effects.
