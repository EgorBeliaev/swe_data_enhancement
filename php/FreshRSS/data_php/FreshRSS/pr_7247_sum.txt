Fix the unread articles counter display issue in the global view by setting `text-indent` to `0` for unread items. Here's the CSS snippet to apply:

```css
#stream.global .feed .item-title:not([data-unread="0"])::after {
    text-indent: 0;
}
```

Test the change by navigating to the global view and verifying that the unread counter is correctly positioned.
