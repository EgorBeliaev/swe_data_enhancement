**Instructions for Implementing Shortcut Feature for Labels**

1. Implement a new keyboard shortcut for the `my labels` menu with the default key `L`. Ensure this shortcut opens the `my labels` list of the active article.

2. Add functionality for numeric keys `1` to `9` to select items from the opened `my labels` list. The `0` key should move the cursor to the input field for further actions.

3. Replace the new untranslated string `conf.shortcut.mylabels` with the already translated existing string `index.menu.tags`. Consider renaming `index.menu.tags` to `index.menu.user_labels` for improved clarity and consistency across the application.

4. Ensure the behavior of the new label shortcut is similar to the existing share menu functionality, allowing quick and efficient item selection without opening additional menus.

5. Test the new feature manually to ensure it works as intended, similar to the existing sharing feature, paying attention to layout adjustments that might be needed to make all entries visible when the labels menu is active.

6. Ensure commit messages are clear and code is robust against manual testing scripts as outlined in PR requirements.
