**Changes to be Made:**

1. **Add CSS Class to Notification Banners:**
   - Introduce `notificationID` as an optional parameter for notification setters to allow individual styling of notification banners.

2. **Assign Notification IDs:**
   - Provide specific notification IDs, especially focusing on `readAction` to address requirements in issue #6409.

**Testing Instructions:**

1. Trigger a notification in the application.
2. Verify that the notification banner includes the additional CSS class associated with the `notificationID`. 

Ensure these changes are reflected in the code base and manually test to confirm functionality.
