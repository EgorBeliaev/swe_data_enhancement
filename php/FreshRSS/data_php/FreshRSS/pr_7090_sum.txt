This GitHub pull request aims to fix category color inconsistency across pie charts in the FreshRSS statistics tab. Below are the concise instructions on the changes to be made:

1. **Create Color Palette Functionality:**
   - Implement `generateColorPalette()` to create a unique color palette based on the number of categories in RSS feeds.

2. **Hex Conversion:**
   - Develop `hslToHex()` to convert the generated color palette into hexadecimal values.

3. **Assign Colors:**
   - Link the generated color palette to the respective categories.

4. **Update Pie Chart Logic:**
   - Modify the pie chart generation logic to incorporate the assigned category colors.

5. **Testing:**
   - Manually verify the feature by running FreshRSS, checking the Main Statistics Tab to ensure uniform colors between the pie charts.

These changes should resolve the issue where category colors did not match across pie charts, making it difficult to visually correlate slices without additional actions.
