**Instructions for Changes:**

1. Implement a box layout on the statistics page that maintains a consistent appearance on larger screens to prevent oversized and unreadable charts.
   
2. Ensure that some numbers in the “Articles Repartition” stats have correct linking to improve navigation and data correlation.

3. Manually test the updated layout by navigating to the `Main statistics` and `Articles repartition` pages to confirm the changes are displayed correctly.

**Issue Being Addressed:**

The PR addresses an issue where the subscription statistics chart becomes too large and difficult to read when viewed on widescreens due to the absence of a maximum content width limit. This is closed under issue #7206, which aimed to confine the display dimensions for improved readability.
