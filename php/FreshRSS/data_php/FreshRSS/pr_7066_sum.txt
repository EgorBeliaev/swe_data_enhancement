**Instruction for Fix Implementation:**

1. **Address Issue #7061**:
   - Implement a fix for the login error message as pointed out in the GitHub issue #7061.

2. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Clear cookies if reproduction of the bug is problematic during testing phases to ensure accurate testing conditions.
   - Post-fix, ensure that the distinction between `Error 403 - Forbidden: Login is invalid` (page level) and `Login is invalid` (notification level, indicating existing account) is still noticeable.

3. **Demo Environment Update**:
   - After merging, update the `demo.freshrss.org` with the fix.
   - Verify after updating that no errors occur during user initialization in the demo environment (handle potential errors like `Error during context user init!`).

4. **Error Remediation in Demo**:
   - Ensure that the reset script is functioning correctly, particularly the proper deletion of the "demo" user, as corrected in commit [031510e]. The demo should operate without issues post-correction.

**Note**: Remain attentive to any further anomalies in the environments involved and address immediately if they occur.
