        "body": "While working on a solution for #6409 I found out that the banner and especially its close button needs an improvement.\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/640de8d1-c23a-4174-8af4-ac5eaff49520)\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges proposed in this pull request:\r\n\r\n- `<button>` instead of the `<a href=\"\">`: semantically much better\r\n- added a little bit accessibility with the ARIA information \r\n- added a `title=\"close\"` attribute to the button\r\n- each theme has now a mouse over feedback (background color change gives feedback)\r\n\r\nHow to test the feature manually:\r\n\r\n1. green `ok/good` notification: go to a config page and click the save button\r\n2. red `bad` notification: go to \"manage users\" and remove the `required` attribute of the username field. Click the save button\r\n3. hover with the cursor over the close button: see the \"close\" title. See the background color change as feedback.\r\n\r\nPull request checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] clear commit messages\r\n- [x] code manually tested\r\n\r\n(more PRs will come for #6409)"
