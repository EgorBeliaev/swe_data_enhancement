The optional name part, was never passed to the rule engine."

When you tested the criteria, you entered the entire header even though in real life only the email address would be passed to it. So, when testing your rule would work but only because you are testing it with the data you want and not the data that would actually be used."

Most users would expect a criteria \"From is myemail@mydomain.com\" to function. If we add the display name, suddenly that doesn't work anymore and they need to use a much more convoluted rule criteria utilizing a regular expression. You can't use a contains or \"finished by\" match because it could match other addresses.\n\nIt can't be considered a bug when it was such an obviously intentional decision. The second code link in my comment shows GLPI constructing the `from` header data using the `mailbox` and `host` parts of the data from `imap_headerinfo`.\n\n`imap_headerinfo` returns an array for `from` because the specification for SMTP allows for multiple From addresses, even though almost nobody uses email that way. I'm not even sure most modern email clients have a way to allow this."
