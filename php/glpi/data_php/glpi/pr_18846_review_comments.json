It works exactly as it is today, allowing copy by clicking into the input or copy button.\r\n\r\nThis PR keeps the current behavior/compatibility to plug-ins that may use the ``<div class=\"copy_to_clipboard_wrapper\"></div>`` as it is today.\r\n\r\nIt adds a change effect similar to the \"Copy to clipboard\" on Debug, which changes the icon from \"check\" to the copy button again to user know it can copy the same information more than once if wanted.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n- It fixes # (issue number, if applicable)\r\n- Here is a brief description of what this PR does\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n"
