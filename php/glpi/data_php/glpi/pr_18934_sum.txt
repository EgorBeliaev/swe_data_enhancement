Change: Adjust ONADD rules logic in the inventory handling process.

1. **Objective:** Ensure the inventory agent tag is processed correctly during both creation and update operations.
2. **Current Issue:** 
   - The `testOtherSerialFromTag()` test was passing despite potential errors in the logic. 
   - Current logic does not allow `InventoryAgent` to be linked before the computer ID is assigned, leading to failure in agent tag addition.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Modify `InventoryAsset::handleInput()` to define `$input['_tag']` for processing during asset handling.
   - Ensure this modification allows for proper rule criteria evaluation by making the tag available early in the process.
