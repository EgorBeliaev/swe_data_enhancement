**Instruction to Programmer:**

Focus on addressing the following issues in the main menu:

1. **Vertical Scrolling:** Resolve any problems with vertical scrolling, especially noticeable when multiple custom asset definitions are created and enabled.

2. **Top-level Menu Item Styling:** Correct the styling issues that occur when a top-level menu item is clicked while the menu is collapsed. Ensure that when the menu is collapsed, the submenu's visibility is managed solely through CSS upon hovering, avoiding interference from Bootstrap's click handling, which leads to unexpected margins in the popover. 

Make sure to test these changes thoroughly to ensure that all styles render correctly in the scenarios described.
