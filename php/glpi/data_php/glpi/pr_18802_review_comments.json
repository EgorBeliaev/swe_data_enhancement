Prior to GLPI 9.4, it was possible to use classnames with numbers in the search engine, for instance via the genericobject plugin. This possibility disappeared when the search engine was refactored, and we did not reverted this limitation because the issue was detected only after the GLPI 9.4.0 release (see https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/pull/5495).\r\n\r\nI think we could reintroduce the possibility to use numbers in itemtypes. The search engine has many test and some of them will probably fail if an unexpected side effect is introduced by this change."
