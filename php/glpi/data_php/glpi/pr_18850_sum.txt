**Instruction for Programmer:**

1. **Objective of PR:**
   - Fix the absence of the TTO date in TTO + SO progression when the ticket status is pending. Ensure the TTO date is displayed without the progress bar in this scenario.

2. **Feedback for Improvement:**
   - Implement a progress bar with a different color (suggested grey) to indicate the unreliability of the displayed TTO, as the TTO will be updated when the ticket's status changes.
   
3. **Visuals Update:**
   - Refer to the attached image for the suggested visual (grey progress bar) implementation. Ensure this representation accurately reflects the incomplete state of the ticket's TTO and progress.

**No changes required for tests or documentation as per the current checklist status.**
