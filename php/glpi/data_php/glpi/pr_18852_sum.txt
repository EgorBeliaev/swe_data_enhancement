### Instructions:

- Replace usage of the method `getEvents()` with `getAllEvents()` in the codebase to prevent PHP warnings related to undefined array keys.
- Check and ensure this change is made in the `src/NotificationTarget.php` file, specifically addressing the warning that occurs at line 1474.
- Test to confirm that restricting notification tags to specific plugins' events no longer produces PHP warnings.
