This is more noticeable when you have several custom asset definitions created and enabled.\r\n- Fix bad styles when clicking a top-level menu item when the menu is collapsed. When collapsed, the visibility of the submenu is handled by CSS when you hover over the top-level items. However, Bootstrap was still trying to handle showing them if you clicked a top-level item and it resulted in unexpected margins in the popover."
