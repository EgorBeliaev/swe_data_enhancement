Ensure that the custom plug-in login provider for GLPI handles cases where the session isn't set by falling back to the default GLPI installation language. This will prevent the "Undefined array key" error when the PHP `display_errors` directive is on, similar to the fallback for the Helpdesk FAQ. Changes should be aimed at the latest stable release branch. No tests or documentation updates have been confirmed as part of this PR.
