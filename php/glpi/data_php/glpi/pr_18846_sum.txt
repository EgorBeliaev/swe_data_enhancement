**Instruction for Programmer:**

- Implement improvements to the "Copy to Clipboard" wrapper using Bootstrap's `input-group` class to address alignment issues.
- Ensure the functionality remains consistent, allowing copying through the input or the copy button.
- Maintain compatibility with existing plugins using the `<div class="copy_to_clipboard_wrapper"></div>`.
- Add a feature that changes the "Copy to Clipboard" button icon from check back to the copy button, allowing users to copy the information multiple times.
- Apply the new wrapper to additional locations, including:
  - "My settings" from the top right menu.
  - "Setup > General > Api (token)".
- Conduct tests across different screen resolutions to ensure consistent functionality and appearance.
