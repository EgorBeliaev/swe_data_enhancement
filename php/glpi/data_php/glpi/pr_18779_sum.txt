The PR simplifies redirection logic by automatically redirecting unauthenticated users to the login form when an `AccessDeniedHttpException` is thrown, removing manual calls to `Session::redirectIfNotLoggedIn()` and `Session::redirectToLogin()`. The `AccessErrorListener` handles this redirection. Feedback suggests correcting error handling: `AccessDeniedHttpException` (403) pertains to unauthorized access and should not trigger login redirection. Instead, verify unauthorized access with `UnauthorizedHttpException` (401). Note: the project's firewall typically handles session invalidity with login redirection; hence, proposed changes to `AccessDeniedHttpException` handling are retracted as unnecessary.
