The pull request proposes renaming the criteria labels for "From" and "To" in the mail collector rules to better reflect their function, as they currently cause confusion by implying they reference the whole header, while they only reference the email address part. The potential renaming should aim to clarify that the rules only consider the email address, not the full header including any display name.
