Anyway, it should not have work with the current logic that is:\r\n1. When the inventory is handled, the agent is created with the `itemtype=Computer` `items_id=0` properties.\r\n2. The computer is then created with `CommonDBTM::add()`.\r\n3. Before it is actually created in DB, the rules are processed in `CommonDBTM::assetBusinessRules()`.\r\n4. At this point, `$this->getInventoryAgent()` can only return `null`, because the computer has not yet any ID, and therefore no agent can be linked to it. No agent tag can be added in `$input['_tag']` and the rule criteria cannot be evaluated.\r\n\r\nWith the proposed change, the `$input['_tag']` is defined in the `InventoryAsset::handleInput()` method in order to be available for both creation and update operations."
