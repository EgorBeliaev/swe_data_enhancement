It permits to remove all manual calls to `Session::redirectIfNotLoggedIn()` and `Session::redirectToLogin()` and to reuse, for this behaviour, the redirection already existing in the `AccessErrorListener`.\r\n"

The places where a a `AccessDeniedHttpException` is thrown are almost always after this firewall check (unless the firewall has been disabled for the corresponding endpoint). So I remove this change that does not seems necessary."
