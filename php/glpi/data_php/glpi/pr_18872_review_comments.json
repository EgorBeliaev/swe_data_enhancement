When logging in, if user isn't authorized to login, it redirects to a custom page, but as the session isn't set (user isn't login), it throws a \"Undefined array key\" error when PHP display_errors directive is on. This PR fallbacks to default GLPI installation language when it's not set - the same fallback that Helpdesk FAQ uses on https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/blob/3f230ed593bd3b5f952853273f7fcb757bcbac7c/front/helpdesk.faq.php#L49\r\n"
