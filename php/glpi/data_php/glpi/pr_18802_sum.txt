The proposed change in this PR entails reintroducing the ability to use numbers in itemtype classnames within the GLPI search engine. This feature was available before GLPI version 9.4 and was inadvertently removed during the search engine refactor. The change aims to restore the capability to use classnames such as `Glpi\\CustomDropdown\\Alpha3CountryCode`, potentially requiring updates to existing tests to ensure no side effects occur.
