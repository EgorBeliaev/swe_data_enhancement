**Instructions for Changes:**

1. **Enhance Reconciliation Engine:**
   - Incorporate the `getUUIDRestrictCriteria()` method into the UUID-based matching rules within the GLPI reconciliation engine.

2. **Update UUID Matching Logic:**
   - Ensure UUIDs are consistently reconciled by updating the matching logic to handle "mixed" UUIDs during the reconciliation process.

3. **Correct Inventory Import Handling:**
   - Update the logic to prevent the incorrect creation of new `Computer` entities when importing inventory files (especially those without agents), by ensuring they reconcile with existing `Computers` based on UUIDs.

4. **Avoid Unnecessary Creations:**
   - Modify the reconciliation process to check existing UUIDs before creating new entries when UUIDs are imported from inventory files without an agent.

These changes address the inconsistency in linking computers during the reconciliation process, especially when dealing with "mixed" UUID formats, and prevent errors in ESX identification.
